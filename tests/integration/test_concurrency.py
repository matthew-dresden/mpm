    """Child-process worker: run a genuine ``install()`` under cross-process locking.

    This worker is the cross-PROCESS analogue of ``_patched_install``. The
    threaded autouse fixtures in this module only patch ``install()``'s repo
    boundary in the parent process, so a forked child must re-install those
    same hermetic mocks itself before calling ``install()``:

      * ``mpm_cli.repo.repo_init`` / ``repo_envsubst`` -> no-ops.
      * ``mpm_cli.repo.repo_sync`` -> writes the minimal manifest XML the
        include-walker parses (mirrors ``_default_repo_sync``).
      * ``_resolve_ref_to_sha`` / ``_check_sha_reachable`` -> deterministic,
        network-free (mirrors the integration conftest autouse fixtures, which
        the child does not inherit because it is a fresh fork target).

    Because each forked child is its own process with its own MAIN thread, the
    POSIX workspace lock's ``signal.setitimer`` / ``SIGALRM`` fail-fast timer
    works correctly (it raises ``ValueError`` only when armed off the main
    thread). The two workers therefore exercise the real cross-process
    ``fcntl.flock`` exclusion rather than an in-process thread race.

    Readiness handshake (no time-based synchronization): the worker sets
    ``ready_event`` once its mocks are in place, then blocks on ``go_event``
    so the parent can release both workers simultaneously. Any exception is
    serialised onto ``error_queue`` so the parent can assert on it.

        mpmenv_path_str: String path to the ``.mpm`` file (multiprocessing
