"""Integration tests for ``mpm why`` live-resolve and lockfile-present paths.

This module contains:

- ``TestWhyLiveResolve``: asserts that ``mpm why <name> --catalog-source <url>``
  exits 0 and returns a dependency chain when no .mpm.lock is present.
  This exercises the live-resolve path in ``commands/why.py``.

- ``TestWhyLockfilePresent``: asserts that bare ``mpm why <name>`` (no
  ``--catalog-source``) exits 0 and returns a dependency chain when .mpm.lock
  is present and contains a top-level ``[[sources]]`` entry for the queried name.
  This exercises the lockfile-present path in ``commands/why.py`` (DEFECT-009
  regression coverage -- ``_build_tree_from_lockfile`` must correctly index
  top-level sources so they are reachable by ``_resolve_match``).

- ``TestByUrlLiveResolve``: asserts that ``mpm why <source-name>
  --catalog-source <url>`` exits 0 and returns a dependency chain rooted at
  the source entry whose catalog URL was used to add it, when no .mpm.lock is
  present. The source name is derived from the entry registered at the catalog
  URL, matching the by-URL addressable chain shape from
  ``test_why_chain_walker.py::TestWhyChainWalkerIntegration``.

- ``TestByPathLiveResolve``: asserts that ``mpm why <source-name>
  --catalog-source <url>`` exits 0 and the stdout chain contains the source name
  when no .mpm.lock is present. The entry is the XML-manifest-path-addressable
  source from the synthetic catalog, exercising the same chain format as
  ``test_why_ambiguous.py::TestWhyXmlPathOnlyMatch`` for the live path.

- ``TestLiveResolveTreePlaceholder``: asserts that ``_live_resolve_tree`` populates
  project nodes when the manifest's ``<remote fetch="${GITBASE}">`` uses a
  placeholder, with GITBASE resolved from the ``.mpm`` globals.  Also asserts
  that source-URL and source root-manifest-path resolve via ``_match_by_url`` and
  ``_match_by_xml_path`` (BUG-2 fix coverage, E53-F1-S1-T1).

Both ``TestByUrlLiveResolve`` and ``TestByPathLiveResolve`` share the module-scope
synthetic catalog fixture with ``TestWhyLiveResolve`` (via ``_live_catalog``).

Autouse fixtures inherited from ``tests/integration/conftest.py``:
  - ``_mock_resolve_ref_to_sha``
  - ``_mock_check_sha_reachable``
  - ``_auto_create_manifest_on_walk``
  - ``_default_allow_insecure_remotes``
