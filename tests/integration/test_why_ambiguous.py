"""Integration test: 'mpm why' ambiguity detection via subprocess.

Builds real file:// fixtures that intentionally force ambiguity:
  - A .mpm file declaring a source whose name normalizes to the same token
    as an XML manifest path after derive_source_name normalization.
  - A .mpm.lock encoding that tree.

Invokes 'mpm why <ambiguous-arg>' via subprocess and asserts:
  - Exit code is non-zero.
  - stderr names both interpretations (XML path AND source name).

Also tests the single-match paths (URL-only and XML-path-only) for completeness.
