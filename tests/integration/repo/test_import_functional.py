"""E2E functional tests: all subcommand imports resolve to working instances.

These tests verify that every entry in ``all_commands`` has an ``Execute``
method (AC-TEST-001) and that the Envsubst command can process a real XML
file placed under a ``.repo/manifests/`` directory tree inside ``tmp_path``
with no git repository required (AC-TEST-002).

The parametrize data for AC-TEST-001 is loaded dynamically from the
``all_commands`` registry so the test automatically covers any new or removed
subcommands without requiring manual updates.
