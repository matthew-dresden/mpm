"""Integration tests for <include> round-trip parsing.

Tests parse a real manifest XML file from disk containing an <include>
element, verify the parsed model reflects the included projects and applied
attributes, and confirm round-trip serialization via ToXml preserves the
expected structural elements.

All tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path. No network or
subprocess calls are made -- these are real file-system operations.
All tests are marked @pytest.mark.integration.

AC-FUNC-001: The happy-path <include> parses without error and the parsed
model matches the XML.
AC-FINAL-010: Real manifest parse + round-trip succeeds against a real
on-disk fixture.
