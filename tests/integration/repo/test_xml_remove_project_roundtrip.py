"""Integration tests for <remove-project> round-trip parsing.

Tests parse a real manifest XML file from disk containing <remove-project>
elements, verify the parsed model reflects the removals applied, and confirm
round-trip serialization via ToXml preserves the expected structural elements.

All tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path. No network or
subprocess calls are made -- these are real file-system operations.
All tests are marked @pytest.mark.integration.

AC-FUNC-001: The happy-path <remove-project> parses without error and the
parsed model matches the XML.
AC-FINAL-010: Real manifest parse + round-trip succeeds against a real
on-disk fixture.
