"""Integration tests for multi-source symlink aggregation in mpm.

Covers the MS-01 multi-source scenario from Category 5 of docs/integration-testing.md
and the CD-01/CD-02 collision detection scenarios from Category 6.

The aggregate_symlinks() function at mpm_cli.core.install:
- Accepts an ordered list of source names and a base directory.
- Creates symlinks in .packages/ pointing into
  .mpm-data/sources/<name>/.packages/<pkg>/ for each package.
- Returns a dict mapping package name to source name.
- Raises ValueError (not SystemExit) on collision when two sources
  produce the same package name.

The repo network calls (repo_init, repo_envsubst, repo_sync) are out of scope
for these tests since they require real git remote servers. All filesystem
state is exercised directly via aggregate_symlinks() against real tmp_path
directories.
