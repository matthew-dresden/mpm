"""POSIX contract integration tests (J11, AC-56).

Asserts the POSIX contract of:
- mpm_workspace_lock: cross-process exclusion, release on exit/exception,
  fail-fast on configurable timeout.
- spawn_detached: detached-process spawn contract (POSIX fork path).
- create_dirsymlink: symlink dir-link helper.

MPM is POSIX-only; the Windows backends were removed (the recommended
Windows path is WSL/WSL2), so there are no Windows-specific branches to
exercise here.

The workspace-lock tests use the real ``mpm_workspace_lock`` context manager
via child processes; the POSIX backend (``fcntl.flock``) gives cross-process
exclusion, asserted here through a non-blocking ``fcntl.flock`` probe of the same
lock region the context manager locks.

No platform-conditional guards are used -- the contract test file collects and
runs on the single Linux set.

FR-34, FR-35, FR-36: spawn_detached and create_dirsymlink POSIX contract.
AC-56: real assertions for every contract property; no platform guards.
