"""Integration-test conftest: autouse fixtures for install engine mocks.

These fixtures patch ``_resolve_ref_to_sha`` and ``_check_sha_reachable`` so
that integration tests using synthetic (non-network) git URLs do not fail
with ``git ls-remote`` errors.  Individual test modules that need the real
implementations can override these fixtures locally (see
``test_install_lockfile_replay.py`` for an example).

The ``_auto_create_manifest_on_walk`` fixture transparently creates a minimal
manifest XML at the expected path whenever ``_walk_includes`` is called and the
target file does not yet exist.  This is needed because tests that mock
``repo_init`` to a no-op or a call-recording side-effect never invoke the real
``repo init`` command, so the ``.repo/manifests/`` tree is never populated.
Without this fixture those tests would fail with ``FileNotFoundError`` inside
the XML include-walker.
