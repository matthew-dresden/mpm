"""Integration tests for the marketplace install state matrix.

Verifies the four AC-TEST-* acceptance criteria for the install/clean

AC-TEST-001: MPM_MARKETPLACE_INSTALL=true + CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR set

AC-TEST-002: MPM_MARKETPLACE_INSTALL=true + CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR unset

AC-TEST-003: MPM_MARKETPLACE_INSTALL=false (or omitted)

AC-TEST-004: marketplace install is cleaned up by mpm clean

AC-FUNC-001: Marketplace path gated by both env vars; missing required
             combination fails fast
AC-CHANNEL-001: CLI-path stderr vs stdout discipline verified (no cross-channel

CLI-boundary behavior is exercised via _install_run() (raises SystemExit).
Library-boundary behavior is exercised via install() (raises ValueError /
