"""Integration tests for <include> cycle detection during mpm install.

AC-TEST-002: Integration test with a three-XML triangle cycle fixture.
AC-CYCLE-001(a): mpm install exits non-zero with IncludeCycleError and the
rendered cycle string.

The fixture creates three manifest XML files in a temporary source workspace
that simulates the checked-out manifest repo after repo sync:
  - a.xml includes b.xml
  - b.xml includes c.xml
  - c.xml includes a.xml (closes the triangle)

When install() is called with this fixture, it must raise IncludeCycleError
before any lockfile is written.
