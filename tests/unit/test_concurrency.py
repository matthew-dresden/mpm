"""Unit tests for mpm_cli.utils.concurrency.

Tests for the public ``mpm_workspace_lock`` contract. There is no platform
skip-marker anywhere in this module (AC-8): every test exercises the public
context manager and its cross-process POSIX backend (``fcntl.flock``).

Covers:
- AC-FUNC-001: eager .mpm-data/ creation before lock acquisition
- AC-FUNC-002: exclusive acquire + release on normal context exit
- AC-FUNC-003: exception inside context still releases the lock (try/finally)
- AC-FUNC-004: cross-process contention -- second process blocks until first releases
- AC-FUNC-005: configurable fail-fast acquisition timeout (#67 / FR-36)
- AC-FUNC-006: #67 re-entrance guard -- nested same-lock acquisition fails fast
- AC-FUNC-007: lock file path built from INSTALL_LOCK_FILENAME constant
