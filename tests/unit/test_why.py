"""Unit tests for the mpm why command.

Covers:
- Single-chain tree: one top-level source -> one matching project -> one line printed.
- Multi-chain same source: project reachable via two different include paths -> two lines.
- Multi-chain different sources: two top-level sources each reaching the same project -> two lines.
- Not-found: project URL not in tree -> hard error with non-zero exit.
- Missing .mpm file -> hard error naming missing path.
- Missing catalog source when no lockfile -> hard error.
- Lockfile present -> skips live-resolve, reads SHAs from lockfile.
- URL canonicalization equivalence: git@github.com and https forms match same project.
- Include-chain placement: projects placed under leaf includes in tree.
- Live-resolve raises LiveResolveError -> run() converts to clean error message.
- _live_resolve_tree returns ResolvedTree with source ChainNodes on success.
- _live_resolve_tree raises LiveResolveError when _resolve_ref_to_sha fails.
- _live_resolve_tree raises LiveResolveError when _enforce_remote_url_policy rejects URL.
