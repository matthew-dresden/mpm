"""Unit tests for maybe_update_accessed_at() -- AC-TEST-001.

Parametrized cases covering every coalescing rule from spec Section 11.4:

- Missing file -> write now + True (first-touch).
- Prior value within window -> no write + False.
- Prior value at exactly the window boundary -> write + True.
- Prior value past the window -> write + True.
- Clock skew: prior_value > now -> rewrite to now + True.
- Non-numeric / corrupt content -> treated as missing, write now + True.
- Two back-to-back calls with delta == 0 -> first writes, second does not.

Mtime assertions use os.stat().st_mtime_ns (nanosecond granularity) to
verify that the no-write case leaves the file physically untouched.

All tests set MPM_HOME to tmp_path so that _mkdir_secure's chmod
walk terminates at the tmp dir (which the test process owns), preventing
PermissionError on /tmp.
