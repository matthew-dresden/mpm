"""Unit tests for mpm why -- three-category argument matching and ambiguity detection.

Covers:
- XML-path-only match: argument matches an include node's path_in_repo.
- Source-name-only match: argument matches a top-level source name via derive_source_name.
- Source-name AND URL ambiguity: hard error listing both interpretations.
- XML-path AND source-name ambiguity: hard error listing both.
- All-three ambiguity: hard error listing all three.
- derive_source_name normalization parity: Foo-Bar matches foo_bar.
- Zero-matches: not-found error preserved from T1.
