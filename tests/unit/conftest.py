"""Unit-test-scoped fixtures for mpm-cli unit tests.

This conftest is loaded automatically by pytest for every test under
tests/unit/.  It provides fixtures that prevent network I/O in unit
tests that call doctor_command with a lockfile.

It also exports shared helper functions used by multiple test modules:

- ``_make_ls_remote_stub``: builds a callable stub that simulates
  ``git ls-remote --tags`` output for injecting into
  ``_check_tag_format`` in catalog audit tests.

    The stub mimics the output format of ``git ls-remote --tags <path>``:

    Shared by ``test_catalog_audit_tag_format.py`` and
    ``test_catalog_audit_project_tag_format.py`` to avoid duplicate helper
    definitions.

    """Auto-patch _run_ls_remote_exit_code so unit tests never make real network calls.

    mpm doctor subcheck 11 calls _run_ls_remote_exit_code for every
    distinct canonicalized remote URL in the lockfile.  When a unit test
    builds a workspace with a real .mpm.lock, doctor_command would issue
    git ls-remote calls to whatever URLs are in the lockfile -- typically
    example.com placeholders that incur real DNS/TCP latency and occasional
    flakiness.

    This fixture short-circuits those calls for every unit test by replacing
    _run_ls_remote_exit_code with a stub that returns (0, '', ''), indicating
    that every remote is reachable.  Tests that need to exercise the
    reachability logic directly (tests/unit/test_doctor_remote_reachability.py)
    inject their own callable stub via the ls_remote_callable parameter and
    do not call _run_ls_remote_exit_code at all -- so this patch does not
    interfere with those tests.
