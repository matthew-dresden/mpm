"""Tests for CI workflow configuration.

Validates the single-Linux-set CI contract for the two validation workflows
(`pr-validation.yml`, `main-validation.yml`) per FR-6 / FR-8 of the
windows-support-removal spec:

- AC-1: No `runs-on: windows-latest` job remains in either validation
  workflow.
- The two-set Linux/Windows matrix is collapsed: each test tier (unit /
  integration / functional / scenario) runs exactly once on a Linux runner
  with the bare tier marker (for example `-m "unit"`, `-m "integration"`),
  with no per-OS marker filter (an `and not <os>_only` exclusion).
- Surviving conventions are preserved: every `run` step uses `shell: bash`,
  the workflow YAML is valid, the integration job runs in parallel with the
  unit job, and the ruff check / format-check steps cover `src/`.

The contract assertions below fail if a `windows-latest` leg or a per-OS
marker filter is reintroduced into either workflow.
