"""Regression guards for the RX (Category 15) fixture preamble in docs/integration-testing.md.

AC-DOC-001: The Category 15 (RX) fixture setup section must document creation of a
bare git repo at the path that the RX manifest XML's fetch+name combination resolves
to, i.e. fixtures/cs-catalog/catalog.

AC-FUNC-001: The cs-catalog source git repository must carry all 7 semver tags
(1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 3.0.0) so that RX scenarios exercising
PEP 440 constraints can resolve to the expected versions.

The RX manifest XML uses fetch="file://.../fixtures/cs-catalog" and name="catalog".
The repo tool resolves each project URL as fetch + "/" + name, so the bare git repo
must live at fixtures/cs-catalog/catalog -- a sub-path of the Category 13 fixture.

These tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit and are collected by `make test-unit`.
