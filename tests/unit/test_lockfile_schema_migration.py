"""Unit tests for lockfile schema migration policy -- updated for schema v5 (FLAG-C).

Schema v5 (spec Section 5.2, Section 13 FLAG-C) is the latest breaking major:
``read_lockfile`` fails fast on any older schema (v1, v2, v3, v4) with an actionable
regenerate error, and no silent upgrader to v5 is registered.  The migration registry
(``_register_upgrader`` / ``_unregister_upgrader`` / ``_dispatch_migration``) remains the
documented extension point for any future NON-breaking bump and is exercised here directly.

Covers:
  - CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION exported and equals 5.
  - Forward-incompatible read (schema_version > current) raises LockfileSchemaError.
  - Older-schema read (schema_version < current) is a hard fail-fast regenerate.
  - _dispatch_migration walks a registered upgrader chain to the current version.
  - _dispatch_migration raises when no upgrader exists for a required step.
  - _register_upgrader rejects duplicate registrations.
  - _dispatch_migration detects a non-advancing upgrader.
  - _unregister_upgrader raises KeyError for unregistered (from, to) pairs.
