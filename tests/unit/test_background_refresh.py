"""Unit tests for mpm_cli.completions.cache.fork_background_refresh.

After E2-F1-S2-T1, fork_background_refresh no longer drives os.fork / setsid /
dup2 directly: it delegates the detached-spawn mechanics to
mpm_cli.utils.spawn.spawn_detached. These tests therefore patch
spawn_detached (the seam fork_background_refresh now depends on) rather than
os.fork. The child-execution behaviour (setsid, /dev/null redirection,
os._exit on success/failure) is exercised against spawn_detached itself in
tests/unit/test_spawn.py and is intentionally NOT duplicated here.

Cases covered:
- MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG=0 (integer zero): spawn_detached NOT called, no
  warning emitted.
- MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG=<non-integer>: spawn_detached NOT called AND a
  warning naming the invalid value is written to stderr (fail-loud, no spawn).
- MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG=1: spawn_detached called exactly once.
- MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG unset: defaults to enabled (spawn_detached called).
- Parent does not block: fork_background_refresh returns after spawn_detached
  without invoking refresh_fn in-process.
- Spawn-failure propagation: when spawn_detached raises RuntimeError,
  fork_background_refresh propagates it (fail-fast, no silent fallback).
- The callable handed to spawn_detached is a picklable functools.partial
  wrapping the module-level _run_refresh_with_logging (required for the Windows
  spawn path).
- MPM_COMPLETION_LOG selects the log path forwarded to spawn_detached.

All cases set MPM_HOME to tmp_path so the real cache is never touched.
