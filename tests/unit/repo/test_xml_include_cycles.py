"""Unit tests for <include> cycle detection and depth-limit enforcement.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Self-reference (A includes A) raises cycle error.
  AC-TEST-002  Two-node cycle (A->B->A) raises cycle error.
  AC-TEST-003  Three-node cycle (A->B->C->A) raises cycle error.
  AC-TEST-004  Include depth limit (MAX_SUBMANIFEST_DEPTH) is enforced.
  AC-TEST-005  Relative path resolution is correct for nested includes.

  AC-FUNC-001  Parser detects all include cycles and enforces depth limit.
  AC-CHANNEL-001  Errors surface as exceptions, not stdout writes.

All tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path via local helpers.
The conftest in tests/unit/repo/ auto-applies @pytest.mark.unit to every
item collected under that directory so the @pytest.mark.unit decorator is
present on every class but is not a formal dependency of test collection.
