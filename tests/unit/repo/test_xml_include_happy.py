"""Unit tests for the <include> element happy path.

Covers AC-TEST-001, AC-TEST-002, AC-TEST-003, and AC-FUNC-001.

Tests verify that valid <include> XML elements parse correctly when given
the minimum required attributes, all documented attributes, and that default
attribute values behave as documented.

All tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path via shared helpers.
The conftest in tests/unit/repo/ auto-applies @pytest.mark.unit to every
item collected under that directory.

The <include> element allows a manifest to include another manifest file.
Documented attributes:
  Required: name (path to included manifest, relative to manifest repo root)
  Optional: groups (list of groups applied to all projects in included manifest)
  Optional: revision (default revision applied to projects in included manifest
            that do not already specify one)
