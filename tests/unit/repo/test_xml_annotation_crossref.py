"""Unit tests for <annotation> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <annotation> are validated
               (remote name resolution -- an <annotation> lives inside a parent
               element whose remote attribute must reference a declared <remote>
               element; an undeclared remote on the parent project raises
               ManifestParseError; when the parent project uses the default
               remote, <annotation> is parsed correctly; for <remote> parents,
               the annotation is processed only when the remote itself is valid)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <annotation> surface clear behavior
               (two <annotation> elements with the same name and same value in
               the same <project> are accepted silently -- the parser does not
               deduplicate; two <annotation> elements with the same name but
               different values are accepted; two <annotation> elements with
               different names are accepted; the same name/value pair in
               different parent elements is valid)
  AC-TEST-003  <annotation> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (a manifest file whose root element is not <manifest>
               raises ManifestParseError before any children are examined;
               an <annotation> element placed directly under <manifest> as a
               top-level child -- not inside any <project>, <remote>, or
               <submanifest> -- is silently ignored by the parser loop)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               documented for <annotation> at parse time (during
               XmlManifest.Load())
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  ManifestParseError, not stdout writes; valid parses produce
                  no stdout output)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of
parser internals.

Cross-element rules for <annotation>:
- <annotation> is a child element of <project>, <remote>, or <submanifest>.
- When <annotation> is a child of <project>, the parent <project> must have
  a resolvable remote (explicit remote attribute referencing a declared
  <remote>, or a <default> remote). An unresolvable parent project raises
  ManifestParseError before <annotation> is processed.
- When <annotation> is a child of <remote>, it is processed as part of the
  <remote> parse; an invalid remote definition raises ManifestParseError
  before any annotation children are reached.
- Duplicate <annotation> elements (identical name and value) inside the same
  parent are accepted by the parser; all entries appear in the annotations
  list (no deduplication).
- An <annotation> element placed at the <manifest> root level (outside any
  parent) is silently ignored -- the parser loop in _ParseManifest does not
  handle 'annotation' node names at that level.
- A manifest file whose root element is not <manifest> raises
  ManifestParseError before any children are examined.
