"""Unit tests for Bug 11: Race condition on concurrent git ls-remote.

Bug reference: specs/BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md Bug 11 -- Race condition on
concurrent git ls-remote. Already addressed by Bug 7 retry logic.

Fix: Dedicated tests verifying that a transient failure during concurrent
access is retried and that the retry log message is produced.
