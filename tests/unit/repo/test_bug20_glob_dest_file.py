"""Unit tests for Bug 20: Glob linkfile silently skipped when dest is a file.

Bug reference: specs/BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md Bug 20 -- When processing glob
linkfiles, if the destination path is an existing file (not a directory),
the code logs an error but continues execution without raising an exception.

Fix: When the destination is an existing file (not a directory), raise an
exception instead of logging and continuing. The error message must include
the destination path.
