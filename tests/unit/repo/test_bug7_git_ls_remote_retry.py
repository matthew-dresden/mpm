"""Unit tests for Bug 7: git ls-remote not retried on transient network errors.

Bug reference: specs/BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md Bug 7 -- git ls-remote calls fail on
transient network errors without any retry.

Fix: Implement a retry loop with a maximum of MPM_GIT_RETRY_COUNT attempts
(default 3). Use exponential backoff starting at MPM_GIT_RETRY_DELAY seconds
(default 1), doubling each attempt. Do not retry on authentication errors.
Log each retry attempt with attempt number and reason.
