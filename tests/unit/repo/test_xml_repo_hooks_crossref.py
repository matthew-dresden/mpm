"""Unit tests for <repo-hooks> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <repo-hooks> are validated
               (e.g. in-project must resolve to a declared project; an
               undefined project name raises ManifestParseError naming the
               project)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <repo-hooks> surface clear errors
               (two <repo-hooks> elements in the same manifest raise
               ManifestParseError with "duplicate" and "repo-hooks" in the
               message)
  AC-TEST-003  <repo-hooks> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (a manifest file whose root element is not <manifest>
               raises ManifestParseError before any <repo-hooks> child is
               processed; within a valid <manifest> root an unknown sibling
               element is ignored without affecting <repo-hooks>)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               for <repo-hooks> at parse time (during XmlManifest.Load())
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  ManifestParseError, not stdout writes; valid parses produce
                  no output)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of parser
internals.

The cross-element rules for <repo-hooks>:
- in-project must name a project that has been declared earlier in the
  manifest (or in included manifests); a mismatch raises ManifestParseError
  with "not found for repo-hooks"
- Only one <repo-hooks> element may appear per manifest; a second raises
  ManifestParseError with "duplicate repo-hooks"
- <repo-hooks> is only reached as a child node of <manifest>; if the file
  root is not <manifest> the file is rejected before any child is processed
