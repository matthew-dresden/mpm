"""Unit tests for <include> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <include> are validated
               (e.g. remote name resolution -- projects pulled in via
               <include> that reference an undeclared remote raise, projects
               with a declared remote resolve correctly, the included manifest's
               remote declarations are visible after loading)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <include> surface clear errors
               (duplicate path caused by a project in an included manifest
               colliding with a project in the primary manifest, same-file
               include twice -- allowed when projects are non-conflicting,
               two includes each contributing conflicting remote declarations)
  AC-TEST-003  <include> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (file whose root element is not <manifest>, <include>
               appearing inside an element that is not the direct manifest
               root, attempting a circular include chain)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               documented for <include>
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  exceptions, not stdout writes)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of parser
internals.
