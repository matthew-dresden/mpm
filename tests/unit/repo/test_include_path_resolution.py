"""Unit tests for <include> path resolution mechanics.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Relative include name resolves relative to the manifest root
               (include_root = manifests/ worktree directory)
  AC-TEST-002  A name that refers to a non-existent file raises a
               "doesn't exist" ManifestParseError that names the file
  AC-TEST-003  restrict_includes enforces path rules: absolute paths and
               paths containing '..' are rejected with ManifestInvalidPathError

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of parser
internals.

Focus: these tests exercise include path *resolution* specifically.
Attribute validity, cross-element rules, and cycle detection are covered by
the sibling test_xml_include_*.py files.
