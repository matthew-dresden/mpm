"""Unit tests for Bug 4: symlink overwrite without warning.

Bug reference: specs/BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md Bug 4 -- project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt
removes and replaces an existing symlink without warning, even when the old
symlink points to a foreign (non-repo-managed) target.

Root cause: project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt lines 452-463 -- the condition
``if not platform_utils.islink(absDest) or (platform_utils.readlink(absDest) != relSrc)``
triggers removal and replacement without checking whether the existing symlink
was repo-managed (i.e. already pointing to relSrc) or foreign (user-created).
No warning is issued before overwriting a foreign symlink.

Fix: Before removing an existing symlink, read its current target with
platform_utils.readlink(). If the target differs from relSrc (foreign symlink),
log a warning that includes both the old target and the new target. Still
overwrite the symlink in all cases -- the fix must not block sync.
