"""Unit tests for <copyfile> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <copyfile> are validated
               (remote name resolution -- a <copyfile> lives inside a
               <project> whose remote attribute must reference a declared
               <remote> element; an undeclared remote on the parent project
               raises ManifestParseError; when the parent project uses the
               default remote, <copyfile> is parsed correctly; the copyfile
               model reflects the parent project's resolved remote)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <copyfile> surface clear errors
               (two <copyfile> elements with identical src and dest in the
               same <project> are accepted silently and both appear in the
               copyfiles list -- the parser does not deduplicate; two
               <copyfile> elements with the same dest but different srcs are
               accepted; two <copyfile> elements with the same src but
               different dests are accepted)
  AC-TEST-003  <copyfile> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (a manifest file whose root element is not <manifest>
               raises ManifestParseError before any children are examined;
               a <copyfile> element at the <manifest> root level -- not
               inside a <project> -- is silently ignored by the parser loop)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               documented for <copyfile> at parse time (during
               XmlManifest.Load())
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  ManifestParseError, not stdout writes; valid parses
                  produce no stdout output)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of
parser internals.

Cross-element rules for <copyfile>:
- <copyfile> is a child element of <project>.
- The parent <project> must have a resolvable remote (explicit remote
  attribute referencing a declared <remote>, or a <default> remote).
  An unresolvable parent project raises ManifestParseError before
  <copyfile> is processed.
- Duplicate <copyfile> elements (identical src and dest) inside the same
  <project> are accepted by the parser; both entries appear in the
  copyfiles list.
- A <copyfile> element placed at the <manifest> root level (outside any
  <project>) is silently ignored -- the parser loop in _ParseManifest
  does not handle 'copyfile' node names at that level.
- A manifest file whose root element is not <manifest> raises
  ManifestParseError before any children are examined.
