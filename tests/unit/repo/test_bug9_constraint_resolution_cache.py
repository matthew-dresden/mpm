"""Unit tests for Bug 9: constraint resolution called twice.

Bug reference: specs/BACKLOG-repo-bugs.md Bug 9 -- _ResolveVersionConstraint()
is called in both Sync_NetworkHalf() and GetRevisionId(). Each call runs
git ls-remote --tags against the remote, wasting network round-trips.

Fix: Add a _constraint_resolved flag to Project. Set it to True after successful
resolution. Skip resolution on subsequent calls when the flag is True. Reset the
flag when revisionExpr is changed via SetRevision().
