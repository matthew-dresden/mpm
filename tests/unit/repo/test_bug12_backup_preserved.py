"""Unit tests for skip-if-exists .bak semantics (replaces Bug 12 remove-then-recreate).

The original Bug-12 fix introduced remove-then-recreate logic: on every run,
the existing .bak was deleted before creating a new one from the current
manifest. This caused the BV-09 scenario to fail -- the second run would
overwrite the first-run baseline with post-substitution content.

These tests verify the correct skip-if-exists contract:
  - First run creates .bak from the original manifest.
  - Subsequent runs leave an existing .bak untouched.
