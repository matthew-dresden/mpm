"""Unit tests for <remove-project> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <remove-project> are validated
               (project name resolution -- remove-project targeting an undeclared
               project raises, with a declared project it resolves correctly;
               base-rev cross-checks the project's revisionExpr)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <remove-project> surface clear errors
               (removing the same project twice, removing after it was already
               removed, removing with a base-rev that does not match)
  AC-TEST-003  <remove-project> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (file root is not <manifest>, remove-project before any
               projects are declared, remove-project appearing after its target
               project -- the normal case)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               documented for <remove-project>
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  exceptions, not stdout writes)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of parser
internals.

The <remove-project> element documented cross-element interactions:
  Required (at least one): name (must match a declared project name)
                           path (must match a declared project relpath)
  Optional: base-rev (must equal the matched project's revisionExpr or
                      ManifestParseError is raised after the full pass)
