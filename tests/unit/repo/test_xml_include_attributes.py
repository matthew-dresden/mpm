"""Unit tests for <include> attribute validation (positive + negative).

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Every attribute of <include> has a valid-value test
  AC-TEST-002  Every attribute has invalid-value tests that raise
               ManifestParseError or ManifestInvalidPathError
  AC-TEST-003  Required attribute omission raises with message naming
               the attribute
  AC-FUNC-001  Every documented attribute of <include> is validated
               at parse time
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of
parser internals.

The <include> element documented attributes:
  Required:  name      (path to included manifest, relative to manifest repo
                        root; validated by _CheckLocalPath at parse time)
  Optional:  groups    (comma-separated groups applied to all projects in
                        the included manifest)
             revision  (default revision applied to included projects that
                        do not specify their own revision)
