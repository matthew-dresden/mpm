"""Unit tests for <submanifest> cross-element and duplicate-element rules.

Covers:
  AC-TEST-001  Cross-element references involving <submanifest> are validated
               (e.g. remote name resolution -- a <submanifest remote="...">
               attribute must reference a declared <remote> element; an
               undeclared remote name raises at Load() time; a submanifest
               path that conflicts with a project path raises ManifestParseError;
               a valid remote reference resolves without error)
  AC-TEST-002  Duplicate-element rules for <submanifest> surface clear errors
               (two <submanifest> elements with the same name but different
               attributes raise ManifestParseError naming the submanifest;
               two <submanifest> elements with the same name and identical
               attributes are accepted idempotently)
  AC-TEST-003  <submanifest> in an unexpected parent raises or is ignored per
               spec (a manifest file whose root element is not <manifest>
               raises ManifestParseError before any <submanifest> child is
               processed; within a valid <manifest> root, an unknown sibling
               element is silently ignored without affecting <submanifest>)

  AC-FUNC-001  The parser enforces all cross-element and uniqueness rules
               documented for <submanifest> at parse/load time
  AC-CHANNEL-001  stdout vs stderr discipline is verified (errors raise
                  exceptions, not stdout writes; valid parses produce no output)

All tests are marked @pytest.mark.unit via the conftest auto-marker.
Tests use real manifest files written to tmp_path -- no mocking of
parser internals.

The cross-element rules for <submanifest>:
- The <submanifest> remote attribute is resolved against the declared
  <remote> elements; an undeclared remote name raises at Load() time.
- Duplicate <submanifest> elements with the same name and the same
  attributes are idempotent (accepted silently).
- Duplicate <submanifest> elements with the same name but different
  attributes raise ManifestParseError. The error message names the
  submanifest.
- A project whose relpath starts with a submanifest relpath raises
  ManifestParseError (path conflict).
- <submanifest> is processed only when it appears inside a valid
  <manifest> root element. A file whose root is not <manifest> is
  rejected before any children are examined.
