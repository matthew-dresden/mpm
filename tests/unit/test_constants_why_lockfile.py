"""Unit tests for WHY_SCOPE_TOP_LEVEL and WHY_SCOPE_TRANSITIVE constants.

Covers AC-FUNC-001: constants.py defines WHY_SCOPE_TOP_LEVEL and
WHY_SCOPE_TRANSITIVE; no inline string literals for these tokens appear in
commands/why.py.

These tests are expected to FAIL (RED) against code that has not yet defined
the constants, and PASS (GREEN) after the constants are added.
