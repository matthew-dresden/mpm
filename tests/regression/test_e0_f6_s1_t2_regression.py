"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S1-T2: linkfile errors silently swallowed.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S1-T2 -- project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt contained a bare
except OSError clause that caught the exception and logged it without re-raising.
Any filesystem failure during symlink creation (permission denied, missing
parent directory, no space left on device) was silently swallowed, leaving the
caller with no indication that the link was not created.

Root cause: project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt lines 462-463 -- bare except OSError
catches the exception and calls logger.error() or similar, then returns normally.
The symlink is never created, but no exception propagates to the caller.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S1-T2): Removed the silent swallow. The except clause
now re-raises with source and destination path context:
    except OSError as e:
        raise OSError(f"Cannot link file {relSrc!r} to {absDest!r}: {e}") from e

This regression guard asserts that:
1. OSError from symlink creation propagates out of _LinkFile._Link().
2. The exact bug condition (symlink fails; caller sees no exception) is blocked.
3. The exception message includes both source and destination path.
4. PermissionError (a subclass of OSError) propagates with exception chaining.
5. The raise-with-chaining guard is structurally present in the source code.
