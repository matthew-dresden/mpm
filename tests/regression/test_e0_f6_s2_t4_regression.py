"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S2-T4: ls-remote errors missing stderr.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S2-T4 / Bug 8 -- when git ls-remote fails and raises
ManifestInvalidRevisionError, the error message did not include the stderr
output from the git subprocess, the remote URL, or the constraint that was
being resolved. Operators had no diagnostic information about what went wrong.

Root cause: project.py _ResolveVersionConstraint() called subprocess.run
directly and constructed ManifestInvalidRevisionError without capturing
result.stderr. The error message contained only a generic "revision not found"
string, making it impossible to determine whether the failure was a network
error, authentication error, or other transient condition.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S2-T3/T4): The retry helper _run_ls_remote_with_retry()
captures result.stderr on every attempt. On final failure it includes the
stderr text, the remote URL, and (via _ResolveVersionConstraint's re-raise)
the constraint expression in the ManifestInvalidRevisionError message.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. The error message includes the stderr text from the failed subprocess
   (AC-TEST-001).
2. The exact bug condition from E0-F6-S2-T4 is reproducible -- a failed
   ls-remote raises ManifestInvalidRevisionError with URL, constraint, and
   stderr in the message (AC-TEST-002).
3. The test passes against the current fixed code for multiple failure types
   (AC-TEST-003).
4. The guard prevents Bug 8 from recurring via a structural source inspection
   (AC-FUNC-001).
5. The error is raised on stderr, not swallowed or printed to stdout
   (AC-CHANNEL-001).
