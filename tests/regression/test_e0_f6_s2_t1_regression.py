"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S2-T1: empty envsubst file list silent.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S2-T1 / Bug 5 -- when envsubst is invoked and
glob.glob() returns an empty list (no files match the pattern), the command
completed silently with no indication that nothing was processed.

Root cause: subcmds/envsubst.py Execute() -- after glob.glob(), there was no
check for an empty result. The for-loop simply did nothing, leaving the user
with no feedback.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S2-T1): After glob.glob(), if the result list is empty,
log a WARNING that includes the glob pattern. Return normally since an empty
match is not a failure condition.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. A WARNING log record containing the glob pattern is emitted when glob
   returns an empty list (AC-TEST-001).
2. The exact bug condition from E0-F6-S2-T1 is reproduced: Execute() is
   called with an empty glob result and must not raise or silently pass
   (AC-TEST-002).
3. The test passes against the current fixed code (AC-TEST-003).
4. The structural empty-list guard is present in the source (AC-FUNC-001).
5. The warning goes to the logging channel, not stdout (AC-CHANNEL-001).
