"""Regression guard for E0-F1-S2-T5: __file__ path assumptions in relocated modules.

Bug reference: E0-F1-S2-T5 -- Six modules in mpm_cli.repo used __file__-relative
path resolution that assumed the modules were at the repository root level. After
relocation to src/mpm_cli/repo/, the __file__ attribute pointed to a different
directory, breaking path calculations for adjacent files and project resources.

Affected modules and their original buggy patterns:
  1. wrapper.py -- os.path.dirname(__file__) for WrapperDir() and WrapperPath().
     After relocation, os.path.dirname(__file__) pointed inside the installed
     package, not the repo root. The repo launcher script was not found.
  2. ssh.py -- PROXY_PATH computed as os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "git_ssh").
     After relocation the git_ssh helper was not found at the computed path.
  3. repo_trace.py -- os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)) to find the repo
     root for trace file placement. After relocation this placed trace files
     inside the installed mpm_cli package directory, not the working directory.
  4. git_command.py -- os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) for project path.
     After relocation the .git directory lookup pointed at a nonexistent path.
  5. project.py -- os.path.realpath(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)))
     for the hooks directory. After relocation hooks were not found.
  6. subcmds/manifest.py -- os.path.dirname(__file__) twice to navigate up to repo
     root for reading docs/manifest-format.md. After relocation the open() call
     raised FileNotFoundError.

Fix (landed in E0-F1-S2-T5): Each module was updated to use one of two patterns:
  - pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent -- for locating adjacent resources
    (wrapper.py, ssh.py, git_command.py, project.py, subcmds/manifest.py)
  - os.getcwd() -- for locating user-cwd-relative resources (repo_trace.py)

The subcmds/manifest.py fix was subsequently superseded by a URL-only helpDescription
that no longer opens a local file at all, removing the __file__ dependency entirely.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. The pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parent pattern is present in each applicable
   module (AC-FUNC-001, AC-TEST-001).
2. The old os.path.dirname(__file__) / os.path.abspath(__file__) patterns that caused
   the bug are absent from each module (AC-TEST-002).
3. The resources resolved by each module actually exist at the expected location
   (AC-TEST-003).
4. manifest.py helpDescription does not attempt to open a local file via __file__
   (AC-TEST-001, AC-TEST-003).
5. The stdout/stderr channel discipline is maintained for any CLI-adjacent behavior
   (AC-CHANNEL-001).
