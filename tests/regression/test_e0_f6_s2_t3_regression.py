"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S2-T3: git ls-remote not retried on transient errors.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S2-T3 / Bug 7 -- git ls-remote calls used by
_ResolveVersionConstraint() to resolve PEP 440 version constraints failed
immediately on transient network errors with no retry. A single dropped
connection or DNS hiccup would cause a sync to fail with no opportunity to
recover.

Root cause: project.py _ResolveVersionConstraint() called subprocess.run with
["git", "ls-remote", "--tags", remote_url] directly, without any retry loop.
If the subprocess returned a non-zero exit code, the function raised
ManifestInvalidRevisionError immediately. No retry was attempted regardless of
the failure type.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S2-T3): Extracted the subprocess.run call into a new
module-level helper _run_ls_remote_with_retry(). The helper reads
MPM_GIT_RETRY_COUNT (default 3) and MPM_GIT_RETRY_DELAY (default 1) from
the environment and runs up to MPM_GIT_RETRY_COUNT attempts with exponential
backoff between failures. Authentication errors (stderr containing
"Authentication" or "Permission denied") are detected and not retried to avoid
credential lockouts. Each retry attempt is logged with attempt number and
reason.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. A transient failure followed by a success resolves the version constraint
   correctly -- the retry mechanism fires and recovers (AC-TEST-001).
2. The exact bug condition from E0-F6-S2-T3 is reproduced: a single transient
   failure that would have caused an immediate error before the fix is now
   retried and succeeds (AC-TEST-002).
3. The test passes against the current fixed code (AC-TEST-003).
4. The structural retry helper is present in the source (AC-FUNC-001).
5. Retry diagnostic warnings go to the logging channel, not stdout (AC-CHANNEL-001).
