"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S2-T2: undefined env vars silently preserved.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S2-T2 / Bug 6 -- after expandvars() processes an XML
manifest file, any ${VARIABLE} patterns that remain in the output indicate
environment variables that were not defined in the calling process. Before the
fix, these unresolved placeholders were silently written back to the output
file with no indication to the user that substitution was incomplete.

Root cause: subcmds/envsubst.py EnvSubst() called search_replace_placeholders()
which ran os.path.expandvars() on every attribute value and text node, then
wrote the result with save() -- but never checked whether any ${...} patterns
remained after the substitution pass. The command exited zero with no log
output, leaving the user unaware that manifest variables were unresolved.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S2-T2): After search_replace_placeholders(), _collect_unresolved_vars()
scans all attribute values and text node values in the DOM for remaining
_UNRESOLVED_PATTERN matches. EnvSubst() logs a WARNING per unresolved variable
name (including the filename). Execute() aggregates unresolved names across all
files and prints a summary line listing them all. The command continues without
failing -- unresolved variables are a warning condition, not an error.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. A WARNING log record containing the variable name and filename is emitted
   for each ${VAR} that expandvars() could not resolve (AC-TEST-001).
2. The exact bug condition from E0-F6-S2-T2 is reproduced: EnvSubst() is called
   on a manifest with undefined variables and must not silently pass -- at least
   one WARNING must be logged (AC-TEST-002).
3. The test passes against the current fixed code (AC-TEST-003).
4. The structural _collect_unresolved_vars guard is present in the source
   (AC-FUNC-001).
5. Diagnostic warnings go to the logging channel, not stdout (AC-CHANNEL-001).
