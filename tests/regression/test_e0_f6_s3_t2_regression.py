"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S3-T2: Bugs 16-20 low severity fixes.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S3-T2 -- Five low-severity bugs fixed:

- Bug 16: Nested variable warning -- Patterns like ${VAR_${INNER}} (nested
  ${...} inside ${...}) must be detected. A WARNING is logged per occurrence
  including the full nested pattern text. The tool does not attempt to resolve
  nested variables.
- Bug 17: Path separators -- Documentation-only fix. No code guard needed.
- Bug 18: envsubst double-parse -- The XML parsing approach was replaced with
  string-based filtering that reads, substitutes, and writes in a single pass.
  The parseString import must not be present in the envsubst module namespace.
- Bug 19: Glob source path error -- When envsubst receives a glob source path
  whose source directory does not exist, os.path.exists() is checked first and
  a clear error message including the non-existent path is raised.
- Bug 20: Glob destination is a file -- When the glob destination path is an
  existing file (not a directory), an exception is raised instead of logging
  and continuing. The error message must include the destination path.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. Bug 16: nested ${...${...}} pattern produces a WARNING with full pattern text.
2. Bug 16: no nested-variable WARNING is logged for plain ${VAR} references.
3. Bug 18: parseString is not present in the envsubst module namespace.
4. Bug 18: EnvSubst() expands variables and writes output without double-parse.
5. Bug 19: non-existent glob source directory raises an exception with the path.
6. Bug 20: file-as-glob-destination raises an exception with the dest path.
7. Bug 20: directory-as-glob-destination does NOT raise an exception.
