"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S1-T1: envsubst malformed XML crash.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S1-T1 -- envsubst crashed with an unhandled ExpatError
when minidom.parse() encountered malformed XML after environment variable
substitution.

Root cause: subcmds/envsubst.py -- minidom.parse() raised ExpatError on
malformed XML with no try-except. Processing crashed and could orphan a .bak
file.

Fix: Wrapped minidom.parse() in a try-except for xml.parsers.expat.ExpatError.
Logs the error with the filename, skips the file, and continues processing
remaining files. Does not create a .bak backup for files that fail to parse.

This regression guard asserts that the fix remains in place and that the
exact bug condition from E0-F6-S1-T1 does not regress.
