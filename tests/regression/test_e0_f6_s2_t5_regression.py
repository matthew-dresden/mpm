"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S2-T5: constraint resolution called twice.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S2-T5 / Bug 9 -- when a Project has a PEP 440 version
constraint in revisionExpr, the constraint resolution logic (which calls
git ls-remote to match available remote tags) is invoked from two separate call
sites in the sync lifecycle:

  1. Project.Sync_NetworkHalf() calls self._ResolveVersionConstraint() at the
     beginning of the network fetch phase to normalise the revisionExpr into an
     exact tag ref before any git operations.
  2. Project.GetRevisionId() calls self._ResolveVersionConstraint() again
     before resolving the local ref, because revisionExpr must be a concrete
     ref by the time rev-parse is invoked.

Before the fix, each call site independently ran git ls-remote --tags against
the remote URL and repeated the full PEP 440 matching logic, resulting in
unnecessary network round-trips -- one per call site per project per sync cycle.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S2-T5): Added a _constraint_resolved boolean flag to
Project.__init__() (default False). _ResolveVersionConstraint() returns
immediately when the flag is True. After a successful resolution the flag is
set to True. SetRevision() resets the flag to False so that a changed
revisionExpr is resolved again on the next call.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. When _ResolveVersionConstraint() is called from two separate call sites on
   the same Project instance, git ls-remote is executed exactly once
   (AC-TEST-001).
2. The exact bug condition from E0-F6-S2-T5 is triggered: direct sequential
   calls to _ResolveVersionConstraint() do not make redundant ls-remote network
   calls (AC-TEST-002).
3. The test passes against the current fixed code for multiple constraint
   expressions (AC-TEST-003).
4. The structural guard (the _constraint_resolved flag) is present and
   functional in the source (AC-FUNC-001).
5. Constraint resolution does not produce output on stdout -- it either resolves
   silently or raises an exception that propagates via the exception channel
   (AC-CHANNEL-001).
