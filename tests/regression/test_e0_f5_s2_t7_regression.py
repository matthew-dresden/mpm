"""Regression guard for E0-F5-S2-T7: concurrent run_from_args race condition.

Bug reference: E0-F5-S2-T7 -- run_from_args() mutates process-global state
(os.execv, _pager_module.EMBEDDED, os.environ) under a snapshot-restore
pattern that is NOT thread-safe. When two threads call run_from_args()
concurrently, each thread snapshots and restores the global values
independently, causing the following races:

  Race 1 -- os.execv corruption
    Thread A captures original_execv_A = os.execv (real execv).
    Thread A sets os.execv = _intercepting_execv_A.
    Thread B captures original_execv_B = os.execv (_intercepting_execv_A).
    Thread B sets os.execv = _intercepting_execv_B.
    Thread A finishes; its finally block restores os.execv = original_execv_A
      (the real execv), removing the interceptor that Thread B installed.
    Thread B now has NO execv interceptor protecting it from RepoChangedException.
    Thread B finishes; its finally block restores os.execv = original_execv_B
      (_intercepting_execv_A), leaving a stale interceptor from Thread A in place.

  Race 2 -- EMBEDDED flag corruption
    Thread A sets _pager_module.EMBEDDED = True.
    Thread B sets _pager_module.EMBEDDED = True.
    Thread A finishes; its finally block sets EMBEDDED = False.
    Thread B is still executing with EMBEDDED = False -- pager protection lost.

Fix (documented in E0-F5-S2-T7): The API contract makes clear that
run_from_args() is safe ONLY for sequential (non-concurrent) same-process
calls. Each call fully restores all mutated global state before returning,
so a subsequent sequential call sees a clean baseline. The tests in
tests/integration/repo/test_process_isolation.py verify the sequential contract.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. The concurrent race mechanism exists as documented (AC-TEST-002): a
   deterministic simulation proves that the shared global state (os.execv,
   EMBEDDED) is corrupted when two threads interleave at the critical section.
2. Sequential calls always restore os.execv and EMBEDDED correctly (AC-TEST-001,
   AC-TEST-003): the sequential contract is intact and the regression guard
   detects when it breaks.
3. The EMBEDDED flag is False outside run_from_args and True during execution
   (AC-FUNC-001): the guard ensures the fix remains in place.

    """AC-TEST-002: Demonstrates the os.execv state corruption when two threads
    call run_from_args concurrently at the critical section.

    This test reproduces the exact race described in the E0-F5-S2-T7 bug
    report by interleaving two threads at the point where each thread captures
    and restores os.execv. A threading.Barrier synchronises the two threads so
    that Thread B captures its snapshot of os.execv AFTER Thread A has already
    replaced it with an interceptor -- the same ordering that the bug report
    identified as the root cause.

    The test proves the bug mechanism is real: after the concurrent run, the
    value left in os.execv is NOT the value that was present before either
    thread started, because one thread's restore clobbered the other thread's
    interceptor at an intermediate point in the execution.

    Bug condition established when:
    - Thread A installs _intercepting_execv_A over os.execv.
    - Thread B captures its snapshot (original_execv_B = _intercepting_execv_A).
    - Thread A's finally restores os.execv = original_execv_A (real execv).
    - Thread B's finally restores os.execv = original_execv_B (_intercepting_execv_A).
    Result: os.execv is left pointing to Thread A's stale interceptor rather
    than the true original. If the regression guard detects this final value
    equals the pre-call original, the race has been fixed (e.g., via a mutex).

    This test verifies the bug condition EXISTS in the current implementation
    by asserting the expected corrupted final state. If run_from_args is made
    thread-safe (e.g., a threading.Lock guards the globals), this test will
    fail, indicating that the concurrency fix should be captured in a dedicated
    concurrency test while this bug-condition test is retired.
