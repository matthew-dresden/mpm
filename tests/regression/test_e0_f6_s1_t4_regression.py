"""Regression guard for E0-F6-S1-T4: symlink overwrite without warning.

Bug reference: E0-F6-S1-T4 -- project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt removed and
replaced an existing symlink without warning, even when the existing symlink
pointed to a foreign (non-repo-managed) target that the user had created
manually.

Root cause: project.py _LinkFile.__linkIt lines 452-463 -- the condition
``if not platform_utils.islink(absDest) or (platform_utils.readlink(absDest) != relSrc)``
triggered removal and replacement without checking whether the existing symlink
was repo-managed (pointing to relSrc) or foreign (pointing to a user-created
path). No warning was issued before overwriting a foreign symlink.

Fix (landed in E0-F6-S1-T4): Before removing an existing symlink, the code
reads its current target with platform_utils.readlink(). If the target differs
from relSrc (foreign symlink), logger.warning() is called with the destination
path, old target, and new repo-managed target. The symlink is still overwritten
in all cases -- the fix does not block sync.

This regression guard asserts that:
1. Overwriting a foreign symlink emits a logger.warning() call.
2. The warning message contains the old (foreign) target path.
3. Overwriting a repo-managed symlink does NOT emit a warning.
4. The symlink is replaced in all cases -- sync is never blocked.
5. The warning logic is structurally present in __linkIt source.
6. No stdout leakage occurs during symlink replacement operations.
