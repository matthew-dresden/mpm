"""Snapshot tests for canonical operator-facing error messages.

Each test case in ``test_error_message_matches_fixture`` corresponds to one of
the 8 canonical errors enumerated by R128 (plus R124 and R190). The test
builds a minimal ``tmp_path`` workspace that triggers the error, runs the
mpm CLI via subprocess, captures stderr and the exit code, strips ANSI CSI
escape sequences, and asserts the captured text equals the fixture file
``tests/fixtures/errors/<slug>.txt`` byte-for-byte.

Fixture files live under ``tests/fixtures/errors/``:

- ``missing-catalog-source.txt``
- ``lockfile-hash-mismatch.txt``
- ``lockfile-sha-unreachable.txt``
- ``entry-not-found.txt``
- ``source-collision.txt``
- ``conflict-detected.txt``
- ``missing-required-metadata-field.txt``
- ``zero-pep440-tags-under-prefix.txt``

Contract: if the source-side error text drifts from the fixture, the test
fails with a diff that names the slug. Failures indicate source/spec drift
that must be remediated source-side (in T3), NOT by changing the fixture.
The fixtures are the canonical reference; the source must match them.

Trigger procedure per slug:
- ``missing-catalog-source``: ``mpm search`` with neither env var nor flag set.
- ``lockfile-hash-mismatch``: ``mpm install --strict-lock`` with a ``.mpm``
  file and a lockfile whose single source entry stays consistent with ``.mpm``
  (same alias and ref-spec) but whose ``mpm_hash`` field intentionally differs
  from the actual hash of the ``.mpm`` file, so the consistency check passes
  and the drift is a pure mpm_hash mismatch.  (A plain ``mpm install`` also
  fails fast on this mismatch; ``--reconcile`` opts back in to reconciling it.)
- ``lockfile-sha-unreachable``: ``mpm install`` with a lockfile whose
  ``resolved_sha`` for a source points to a SHA that ``git ls-remote`` cannot
  find on the declared remote.  Uses an unreachable HTTPS remote so git fails
  without a network call.
- ``entry-not-found``: ``mpm add <name>`` against a local bare catalog repo
  that has no entry with that exact name.
- ``source-collision``: a re-add of an existing package -- a ``.mpm`` already
  carries the ``example_pkg`` block at ``refs/tags/v1.0.0`` and a second
  ``mpm add example_pkg@==1.0.0`` for the same source@ref hits the same-NAME
  guard (spec Section 4.2). Without ``--force`` this is a hard error; a
  cross-source same-name add would instead auto-suffix.
- ``conflict-detected``: ``mpm install`` with two ``.mpm`` sources that
  both resolve to the same canonical URL but carry different SHAs (written
  directly into the lockfile to avoid a real network call).
- ``missing-required-metadata-field``: ``mpm add`` against a local bare
  catalog repo whose XML is missing a required ``<catalog-metadata>`` field.
- ``zero-pep440-tags-under-prefix``: ``mpm add <entry>`` (no explicit
  revision spec) against a local bare catalog repo whose tags are all
  non-PEP-440.
