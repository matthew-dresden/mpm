"""Happy-path functional tests for 'mpm repo diff'.

Exercises the happy path of the 'repo diff' subcommand by invoking
``mpm repo diff`` as a subprocess against a real initialized and synced
repo directory created in a temporary directory. No mocking -- these tests
use the full CLI stack against actual git operations.

The 'repo diff' subcommand shows uncommitted changes across all projects. On
a freshly synced repository with no uncommitted changes, the command exits 0
and produces no diff output. When a project path filter is supplied as a
positional argument, the diff is restricted to that project.

Note on AC-TEST-001 wording: the AC states "'mpm repo diff' with default
args exits 0". 'repo diff' accepts zero positional arguments (all projects
are checked by default), so the simplest invocation form uses no extra
arguments at all. All tests below use a freshly synced repository with no
uncommitted changes so exit code 0 is deterministic.

Covers:
- AC-TEST-001: 'mpm repo diff' with default args exits 0 in a valid repo.
- AC-TEST-002: Every positional argument of 'repo diff' has a happy-path test.
  Positional arguments: [<project>...] (optional project name or path filter).
- AC-FUNC-001: 'mpm repo diff' executes successfully with documented default
  behavior.
- AC-CHANNEL-001: stdout vs stderr channel discipline (no cross-channel leakage).

Tests are decorated with @pytest.mark.functional.
