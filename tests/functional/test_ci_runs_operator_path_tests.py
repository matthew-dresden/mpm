"""Guard test: verifies the CI workflow runs the operator-path scenario tests
on every PR.

Parses `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` and the `Makefile` from the
project root (derived at runtime from this file's own path -- no hard-coded
absolute paths) and asserts:

1. The workflow triggers on `pull_request` events.
2. A job in the workflow invokes `make test-scenarios` or
   `make test-operator-path`, so the operator-path scenario tests run on
   every PR.
3. The invoked make target selects the `scenario` marker (cross-checked
   against the Makefile recipe), confirming the assertion is end-to-end and
   not a superficial string match on the workflow alone.

These assertions fail if a future edit removes the `scenario-tests` job or
renames the make target without updating the CI wiring, acting as a
regression guard for E50-F1-S1-T2.
