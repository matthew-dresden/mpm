"""J7 -- MPM_HOME shared-store journey (spec Section 10.4 / FR-15, FR-16).

Exercises the content-addressed store end to end:

- Two project directories sharing one ``MPM_HOME`` install the same
  ``manifest@SHA`` and dedup to a single content-addressed store entry.
- A publish is concurrency-safe under real contention: two processes publishing
  the same address race for a per-entry lock and the loser observes the winner's
  fully-published entry (readiness via final-path existence, never a sleep).
- A conditional ``.gitignore`` safety net is written into the store only when the
  resolved ``MPM_HOME`` sits inside a git working tree.

All assertions are real and falsifiable; there is no ``skipif`` and no
time-based synchronisation anywhere in this module.
