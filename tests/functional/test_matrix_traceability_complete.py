"""Guard test: matrix-traceability completeness for findings-rerun-2026-05-30.

Mechanically asserts that ``docs/testing/matrix-traceability.md`` cites a
named, collectable test for every scenario row in
``test-fixtures/findings-rerun-2026-05-30.md``. A future FAIL row cannot
exist without a mapped test -- this is the guardrail that would have caught
the Section 1.3 gaps (spec Section 4 EPIC E50 / E50-F2).

The guard:
1. Parses the findings-rerun matrix to extract the full scenario-row set
   (row number, scenario name, type).
2. Parses the traceability doc to extract the "covered by" citations for
   each row.
3. Asserts every matrix row has at least one citation (or a documented
   manual-only annotation).
4. Asserts every cited test node is collectable via pytest collection.

Note: the 2026-05-30 matrix uses grouped rows (e.g. ``| 20-26 |``) for
bulk-PASS ranges; the row parser only matches individually-numbered rows.
The parsed row count for 2026-05-30 is 55 (rows 20-26 and 37-59 are
grouped and excluded from the numeric scan).

Paths are resolved at runtime from the repository root -- no hard-coded
absolute paths.
