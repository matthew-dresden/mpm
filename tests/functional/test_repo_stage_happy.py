"""Happy-path functional tests for 'mpm repo stage'.

Exercises the happy path of the 'repo stage' subcommand by invoking
``mpm repo stage`` as a subprocess against a real initialized and synced
repo directory created in a temporary directory. No mocking -- these tests
use the full CLI stack against actual git operations.

The 'repo stage' subcommand stages file(s) for commit using interactive git
staging (``git add --interactive``). The ``-i`` / ``--interactive`` flag is
required for any meaningful invocation: without it the command prints usage
and exits with a non-zero code. The happy path exercised in this module
supplies ``-i`` to a synced repository that has no uncommitted modifications;
in that case the command logs "no projects have uncommitted modifications" to
stderr and returns 0 without entering the interactive loop.

Deviation from AC wording: AC-TEST-001 says "with default args" exits 0. The
real default behavior (no args) calls Usage() and exits non-zero. This module
therefore uses ``-i`` (the required interactive flag) as the minimal invocation
that produces a 0 exit code. This deviation is documented here so reviewers
can verify the test asserts the actual CLI behavior rather than a
misinterpretation of the AC wording.

Covers:
- AC-TEST-001: 'mpm repo stage -i' exits 0 in a valid synced repo with no
  dirty projects (the only invocation pattern that exits 0 for this command).
- AC-TEST-002: Every positional argument of 'repo stage' has a happy-path test
  (project name and project path references are exercised via parametrize).
- AC-FUNC-001: 'mpm repo stage -i' executes successfully with documented
  default behavior (exit 0 when no uncommitted modifications are present).
- AC-CHANNEL-001: stdout vs stderr channel discipline (no cross-channel leakage).

Tests are decorated with @pytest.mark.functional.
