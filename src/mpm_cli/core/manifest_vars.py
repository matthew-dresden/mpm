"""Shared detection of functional ``${VAR}`` placeholders in a manifest tree.

Both ``mpm add`` (detection against the UNRESOLVED catalog manifest) and the
``install`` guard (verification against the RESOLVED, post-envsubst manifest)
must agree on EXACTLY which ``${VAR}`` placeholders matter. A ``${VAR}`` matters
only when it appears in a *functional* attribute value -- one the repo tool
consumes during ``repo sync`` -- namely the attributes of the ``<remote>``
elements a ``<project>`` references (explicitly via ``remote="NAME"`` or via the
``<default>`` remote) and the attributes of the ``<project>`` elements
themselves.

A ``${VAR}`` that appears only in an XML comment, a ``<![CDATA[...]]>`` block,
or element text is documentation prose: the repo tool never substitutes it and
``repo sync`` never consumes it, so it must be ignored. ``xml.etree`` only
exposes attribute values via ``Element.attrib``; comments, CDATA, and element
text never appear there, so scanning ``attrib`` values is functional by
construction.

This module is the single source of truth for "which ``${VAR}`` names are
functional in a manifest + its ``<include>`` tree" so the add-side detector and
the install-side guard stay consistent by construction (DRY).
