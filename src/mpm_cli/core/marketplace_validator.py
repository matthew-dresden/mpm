"""Validate marketplace XML manifest files.

Checks:
  - All <linkfile dest> attributes use the ${CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR}
    variable prefix, rejecting hard-coded or relative paths.
  - All <include> chains are unbroken (every referenced file exists).
  - All flattened project path names are unique across manifests.
  - All <project revision> attributes are pinnable refs: an exact existing git
    tag (refs/tags/<deep/path>/<pep440>), a branch ref (refs/heads/<name>), or a
    40-hex commit SHA. Wildcards (*) and version-range constraints (>=, <, ',',
    ~=) are rejected: the model is exact-tag-or-branch-or-sha, never an arbitrary
    spec (spec Section 4.5 / Section 6 / FR-22, AMENDED 2026-06-25). On install
    a branch or tag resolves to a content SHA pinned in .mpm.lock (npm-style),
    so determinism rests on the locked content SHA, not on tag immutability.
  - Every <project revision> -- including a revision a <project> inherits from
    the manifest's <default revision> -- is existence-checked against the
    project's resolved remote via git ls-remote (two-tier: a local/file://
    repo resolves offline; a remote repo degrades to format-only with a warning
    when the host is offline, unless the CI/gate flag makes existence mandatory).

    single-purpose poly repos, issue matthew-dresden/mpm#82) accepts any of

        <40-hex>                         -- a full 40-character commit SHA.

    For the tag shapes, ``<pep440>`` is a single, canonical PEP 440 version token

    component must be non-empty. For the branch shape, the name after
    ``refs/heads/`` must be non-empty.

    The wildcard ``*``, a bare branch name (e.g. ``main`` without the
    ``refs/heads/`` prefix), and a single or compound version-range constraint
