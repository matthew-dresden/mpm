"""Multi-source MPM install business logic.

Parses .mpm, validates sources, creates isolated source workspaces
under ``.mpm-data/sources/<name>/``, runs ``repo init``/``envsubst``/``sync``
per source, aggregates symlinks into ``.packages/``, detects collisions,
updates ``.gitignore``, and optionally installs marketplace plugins.

Concurrent installs on the same project directory are serialized via an
exclusive workspace lock on ``.mpm-data/.mpm-install.lock`` (via
``mpm_workspace_lock`` in ``utils/concurrency.py``). The same lock is
shared with ``mpm add``, ``mpm remove``, and
``mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache`` so all mutating commands
serialise on a single per-workspace lock.

Lockfile state machine
----------------------
Every ``mpm install`` invocation inspects the state matrix:

  LOCKFILE_ABSENT        -- .mpm.lock absent; resolve fresh, write lockfile.
  LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT    -- .mpm.lock present and mpm_hash matches; replay SHAs
                            and replay the locked content pins (v5).
  LOCKFILE_HASH_MISMATCH -- .mpm.lock present but mpm_hash differs.  Default
                            install FAILS FAST (the FR-24 .mpm <-> .mpm.lock
                            consistency check runs before resolving and the lock is
                            never mutated; npm ci).  --reconcile opts back in to the
                            lenient RECONCILE; --refresh-lock rebuilds the whole lock.
  RECONCILE              -- --reconcile opt-in: prune orphans, resolve added/changed
                            sources fresh, replay unchanged sources, rebuild + write
                            the lock once at the end on success only.
  LOCKFILE_UNREACHABLE   -- lockfile SHA no longer reachable on remote; hard error.
  REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE    -- operator requested partial lockfile rebuild via --refresh-lock-source.

``mpm install`` is hermetic (spec Section 4.3 / FR-14): the schema-v5 lock carries
no ``[catalog]`` block, so install neither resolves nor records a catalog source.  It
is driven solely by the committed ``.mpm`` (+ ``.mpm.lock``); ``--catalog-source``
is not accepted by the install parser (passing it exits non-zero), and a populated
``MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`` environment variable has no effect on install (it is ignored,
not read).

Exception hierarchy:

  InstallError                -- base class for all install-state hard errors (defined in
                                 core/include_walker.py; re-exported here for backwards compatibility).
  MPMHashMismatchError      -- mpm_hash in lockfile != freshly-computed hash.
  LockfileUnreachableShaError -- a lockfile SHA is no longer reachable on remote.
  UnknownSourceError          -- --refresh-lock-source name does not match any source.
  OrphanedLockEntryError      -- --strict-lock: lockfile source absent from .mpm.
  BranchDriftError            -- --strict-drift: branch tip differs from locked SHA.
  PackagePathConflictError    -- two+ sources resolve the same package path to different content SHAs.
  IncludeCycleError           -- <include> chain contains a cycle (re-exported from include_walker).

Include-tree resolution:

  _walk_includes and IncludeTree are implemented in core/include_walker.py and
  re-exported here so call-sites can use either import path.  The walker uses a
  two-set DFS algorithm to detect cycles (raises IncludeCycleError) and
  deduplicate diamond paths (shared nodes appear only at their first-walked
  position).

    ``remote`` cannot be resolved to a concrete fetch URL, or whose joined URL is
    not canonicalizable, are skipped -- matching the live ``why`` resolver, which

    ``--strict-lock`` is the ``npm ci`` analogue: it errors on ANY drift and never
    mutates the lockfile.  This helper only decides WHICH error to raise; the
    caller raises it without writing anything.

    The drift is "purely orphans" iff the operator's only change was removing one
    or more sources: at least one lockfile source is absent from ``.mpm`` (the
    orphans), NO ``.mpm`` source is absent from the lockfile (no additions), and
    every surviving source's ``.mpm`` revision spec still equals its locked
    ``revision_spec`` (no changed specs).  In that case ``OrphanedLockEntryError``
    -- which names each orphan and the remediation -- is the precise error.

    Any other mismatch (a newly-added source, or a changed revision spec on an
    existing source -- which keeps the same source-name set but still changes the
    ``mpm_hash``) is reported as ``MPMHashMismatchError``; its message already
    advises ``--refresh-lock`` / ``--refresh-lock-source``.

            ``.mpm`` ``REVISION`` value.  When provided, a surviving source whose
            spec changed (relative to the locked entry) downgrades the decision from

    This is the inner implementation called by install() after the exclusive

    Implements the lockfile state-machine branching:
    - LOCKFILE_ABSENT: resolve fresh, install, write lockfile.
    - LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT: install exactly the SHAs in the lockfile; skip resolve.
    - LOCKFILE_HASH_MISMATCH (default, npm ci): FAIL FAST -- the .mpm <-> .mpm.lock
      consistency check (FR-24) runs before resolving, so a drifted pair exits 1
      with an actionable error and the lock is never mutated.  Reconciliation is
      opt-in via ``--reconcile``; a full rebuild is opt-in via ``--refresh-lock``.
    - LOCKFILE_HASH_MISMATCH (--reconcile, npm install): derive RECONCILE -- prune
      orphans, resolve added/changed sources fresh, replay unchanged sources,
      rebuild + write the lockfile once at the end on success only.
    - REFRESH_LOCK: ignore lockfile entirely, re-resolve fresh, overwrite lockfile.
    - REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE: re-resolve exactly one source chain, preserve all others.

    Content-SHA locking (spec Section 5.2, AMENDED 2026-06-25): on a fresh
    resolve (LOCKFILE_ABSENT / REFRESH_LOCK / a re-resolved source) each project's
    content commit SHA is captured after ``repo sync`` and recorded as a v5
    content pin.  On a replay (LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT / RECONCILE replay / preserved
    REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE entry) the locked content SHAs are written onto the synced
    manifest before sync, so the exact locked content is checked out byte-for-byte
    and a branch/tag tip is never silently re-resolved.

    All errors propagate unconditionally. There is no fallback logic.

    ``mpm install`` is hermetic (spec Section 4.3 / FR-14): it is driven solely
    by the committed ``.mpm`` (+ ``.mpm.lock``).  No catalog source is threaded
    through this function; a populated ``MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`` env var is ignored
    (never read here), and ``--catalog-source`` is not registered on the install
    parser so it cannot reach this code path.

    Args:
        mpmenv_path: Resolved absolute path to the .mpm configuration file.
        lockfile_path: Path to the .mpm.lock file (may or may not exist).
        refresh_lock: When ``True``, short-circuit to ``InstallState.REFRESH_LOCK``
            regardless of lockfile presence or hash state.
        refresh_lock_source: When set, re-resolve exactly the named source chain
            while preserving all other lockfile entries.
        strict_lock: When ``True``, upgrade orphaned lock entries (sources in the
            lockfile but absent from ``.mpm``) to ``OrphanedLockEntryError``
            instead of pruning with an info-line.  Only applies in the consistent
            state; on a hash mismatch the default is already fail-fast.
        strict_drift: When ``True``, upgrade branch drift (branch tip on remote
            differs from locked SHA) to ``BranchDriftError`` instead of reusing
            the locked SHA with an info-line.  Only applies in the consistent state.
        reconcile: When ``True``, opt back in to the lenient npm-install reconcile
            on a hash mismatch (prune orphans, re-resolve added/changed sources,
            replay unchanged ones, rewrite the lock on success).  Default ``False``
            fails fast on drift via the FR-24 consistency check before resolving.

    Raises:
        LockfileConsistencyError: On the default (non-``--reconcile``) path when the
            ``.mpm`` and ``.mpm.lock`` alias sets or per-alias ref-specs have
            drifted (the FR-24 consistency check runs before resolving).
        MPMHashMismatchError: On the default path when the lockfile's mpm_hash
            differs for a reason the consistency check does not cover (e.g. a PATH
            change) other than a pure source removal.  ``--reconcile`` reconciles
            instead of raising.
        UnknownSourceError: If ``refresh_lock_source`` does not match any known
            top-level source name (by literal or derive_source_name match).
        OrphanedLockEntryError: If ``strict_lock=True`` and the lockfile contains
            sources absent from the current ``.mpm`` source declarations.
        BranchDriftError: If ``strict_drift=True`` and a branch-shaped source's
            remote tip differs from the locked SHA.
        PackagePathConflictError: If two or more sources resolve the same package
            destination path (``.packages/<name>``) to different content SHAs.
            Raised on both the absent-lockfile path (after fresh resolution) and

    """Execute the full MPM install lifecycle.

    Acquires an exclusive workspace lock via ``mpm_workspace_lock`` on
    ``.mpm-data/.mpm-install.lock`` before performing any filesystem
    mutations. This serializes concurrent invocations so that two simultaneous
    ``mpm install`` runs on the same project directory do not interleave their
    writes. The same lock is acquired by ``mpm add``, ``mpm remove``, and
    ``mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache`` so all mutating commands
    serialise on a single per-workspace lock.

    The ``.mpm-data/`` directory is created eagerly before the lock is
    acquired (inside ``mpm_workspace_lock``) so that a first invocation in a
    fresh workspace does not fail with ``FileNotFoundError``.

    Steps:
      1. Acquire exclusive workspace lock (creates .mpm-data/ if absent).
      2. Classify the lockfile state via _classify_install_state.
         When refresh_lock=True, short-circuits to InstallState.REFRESH_LOCK.
         When refresh_lock_source is set, uses InstallState.REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE.
      3. Parse .mpm and validate sources.  install is hermetic and resolves
         solely from the committed .mpm (+ .mpm.lock); a populated
         MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES env var is ignored and --catalog-source is not
         registered on the install parser.
      3a. In LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT state: detect orphans and branch drift.
         Prune orphans (or raise OrphanedLockEntryError with --strict-lock).
         Log drift info-lines (or raise BranchDriftError with --strict-drift).
      5. If any dependency sets MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE=true: create
         and clean the marketplace dir.
      6. For each source: mkdir, repo init (or lockfile replay), envsubst, sync.
         On the REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE path, only the named source is re-resolved;
         all other sources replay their pinned SHAs from the existing lockfile.
      7. Aggregate symlinks into .packages/.
      8. Update .gitignore.
      9. Emit state info-line via _emit_install_state.
      10. If any dependency sets MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE=true: run the
          marketplace install script.
      11. Write .mpm.lock: full write for LOCKFILE_ABSENT/REFRESH_LOCK/RECONCILE;
          partial merge for REFRESH_LOCK_SOURCE; pruned rewrite for
          LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT with orphans; unchanged for LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT
          without orphans.  On the RECONCILE path the lockfile is written once at
          the end on success only (nothing is persisted earlier).

    Args:
        mpmenv_path: Path to the .mpm configuration file.
        lock_file_path: Pre-resolved path to the .mpm.lock file. The caller
            is responsible for resolution via ``derive_lock_file_path``; this
            function does not apply any fallback or derivation.
        refresh_lock: When ``True``, ignore the existing lockfile entirely and
            rebuild it from scratch.  Default ``False`` preserves prior behaviour.
        refresh_lock_source: When set to a source name or catalog entry name,
            re-resolve exactly that source's chain while preserving every other
            lockfile entry verbatim.  Mutually exclusive with ``refresh_lock``
            (enforced at the CLI level by argparse).  Default ``None`` preserves
            prior behaviour.
        strict_lock: When ``True``, upgrade orphaned lock entries to
            ``OrphanedLockEntryError`` instead of pruning with an info-line.  Only
            applies in the ``LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT`` state.  Default ``False``
            preserves prior behaviour (prune + info-line).
        strict_drift: When ``True``, upgrade branch drift to
            ``BranchDriftError`` instead of reusing the locked SHA with an info-line.
            Only applies in the ``LOCKFILE_CONSISTENT`` state.  Default
            ``False`` preserves prior behaviour (reuse + info-line).
        reconcile: When ``True``, opt in to the lenient npm-install reconcile on a
            hash mismatch (prune orphans, re-resolve added/changed sources, replay
            unchanged ones).  Default ``False`` fails fast on ``.mpm`` <->
            ``.mpm.lock`` drift via the FR-24 consistency check before resolving.

    Raises:
        LockfileConsistencyError: On the default (non-``--reconcile``) path when
            ``.mpm`` and ``.mpm.lock`` have drifted (alias-set or per-alias
            ref-spec mismatch) -- the FR-24 consistency check runs before resolving.
        MPMHashMismatchError: On the default path when the mpm_hash differs for
            a reason the consistency check does not cover, other than a pure source
            removal.  ``reconcile=True`` reconciles instead of raising.
        UnknownSourceError: If ``refresh_lock_source`` does not match any known
            top-level source name by direct lookup or via ``derive_source_name``.
        OrphanedLockEntryError: If ``strict_lock=True`` and the lockfile has
            sources absent from the current ``.mpm`` declarations.
        BranchDriftError: If ``strict_drift=True`` and a branch-shaped source's
            remote tip differs from the locked SHA.
        ValueError: If marketplace install is requested but
            CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR is not configured, or on package collision.
        OSError: If the managed data directory or a source directory cannot be
            created, with the failing path and OS error message included.
        RepoCommandError: If any repo sub-command exits non-zero.
