"""MPM clean business logic for full teardown.

Performs full MPM teardown in the following order:
  1. Resolve symlinks in mpmenv_path so teardown targets the real project directory
  2. Determine marketplace state: consult .mpm.lock (marketplace_registered field)
     when present; fall back to the .mpm per-dependency
     MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE flags (registered when ANY dependency opts
     in) for old lockfiles or when no lockfile exists (back-compat, AC-8).
  3. Resolve the artifact base directory via resolve_workspace_base_dir: the
     shared MPM_HOME store (<MPM_HOME>/store, default ~/.mpm-home/store), from
     which .packages/ and .mpm-data/ are removed.
  4. If marketplace was registered: uninstall marketplace plugins via claude CLI,
     then remove CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR.
  5. Remove .packages/ directory (ignore_errors=True)
  6. Remove .mpm-data/ directory (ignore_errors=True)
  7. Prune the content-addressed store entries via prune_store (spec Section 3.5)

    Steps:

      2. Parse .mpm.
      3. Resolve the artifact base directory via ``resolve_workspace_base_dir``:
         the shared ``MPM_HOME`` store (``<MPM_HOME>/store``, default
         ``~/.mpm-home/store``).  This mirrors the resolution used by install so
         clean removes exactly what install wrote.
      4. Determine marketplace state from .mpm.lock (marketplace_registered) when
         present; fall back to the .mpm per-dependency
         MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE flags (registered when ANY dependency
         opts in) for old lockfiles or when no lockfile exists.
      5. If marketplace was registered: run uninstall, remove marketplace dir.
      6. Remove .packages/ and .mpm-data/, then prune the content-addressed
         store entries (spec Section 3.5 / FR-16).

    The lockfile-first lookup ensures that an install whose registered set differs
    from the current .mpm flags (e.g. a dependency's
    MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE was flipped off after install) is cleaned up
    correctly: the lockfile records the actual install-time state, so clean does
    not rely on the potentially stale .mpm flags.

    Args:
        mpmenv_path: Path to the .mpm configuration file. May be a symlink;
            the path is resolved before use so teardown targets the real project directory.
        orphans: When True, before the normal teardown, unregister the
            marketplaces of any sources recorded in ``.mpm.lock`` that are no
            longer declared in the current ``.mpm`` (pruning them from
            ``~/.claude``).  A marketplace also provided by a still-referenced
            source is retained.  The default (False) leaves the teardown path
            byte-for-byte unchanged.
        purge: When True (``mpm clean --purge`` / ``--purge-all``), also delete
            this project's ``.mpm`` file and ``.mpm.lock`` after the artifact
            teardown. No-op for files that are already absent.
        purge_home: When True (``mpm clean --purge-all``), also remove the shared
            mpm home store directory (``MPM_HOME``): only its mpm-owned
            subdirs (``store/``, ``cache/``) plus the emptied root, refusing unsafe
