"""Manifest XML helpers for the catalog audit remote-url check.

Public API:
    collect_remote_url_findings(target_path, env) -> list[tuple[str, str, str, str]]
        Walk every *-marketplace.xml under target_path/repo-specs/, follow
        <include> chains depth-first, collect every <project remote="X"> and
        resolve "X" to a fetch URL by searching <remote name="X" fetch="...">
        definitions reachable in the same file and its includes.

        Returns a list of (kind, code, message, remediation) tuples:
            R001 -- <remote name="X"> cannot be resolved in the include chain.
            R002 -- Resolved fetch URL uses a non-HTTPS/non-SSH scheme and
                    MPM_ALLOW_INSECURE_REMOTES != "1".
            R003 -- Resolved fetch URL contains a query string ("?") or
                    fragment ("#"); canonicalization is undefined.

    walk_includes_collecting_remotes(xml_path, manifest_repo) -> dict[str, str]
        Depth-first include walker that accumulates <remote name="..."> ->
        fetch="..." mappings from xml_path and all recursively included XML
        files. Used by collect_remote_url_findings.

Spec references:
    spec Section 3.5 soft-spot rule 4 (<remote> definition discoverability).
    spec Section 3.6 (HTTPS-by-default; MPM_ALLOW_INSECURE_REMOTES).
