"""TOML lockfile parser and atomic writer -- schema v5.

Public entry points:
  - ``read_lockfile(path: Path) -> Lockfile``: parse and validate a TOML lockfile.
    Applies schema migration policy (spec Section 5.2) when schema_version differs
    from CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION.
  - ``write_lockfile(lockfile: Lockfile, path: Path) -> None``: atomically serialise
    a Lockfile to disk using a write-temp-then-rename pattern.
  - ``check_lockfile_consistency(mpm_aliases, mpm_ref_specs, lockfile) -> None``:
    verify the ``.mpm`` alias declarations agree with the ``.mpm.lock`` entries
    (alias uniqueness, alias-set parity, per-alias ref-spec parity; spec FR-24,
    Section 4.5).  ``mpm validate lockfile`` runs this check, and ``mpm install``
    runs it implicitly before resolving (spec Section 4.3).
  - ``reconcile_declared_installed(mpm_aliases, mpm_ref_specs, lockfile) ->
    SourceReconciliation``: the non-raising core of ``check_lockfile_consistency``;
    returns the installed / not-installed / orphaned alias partition (plus duplicate
    and ref-spec-mismatch diagnostics) so a read-only caller (``mpm list``) can
    render the declared-vs-installed divergence instead of failing on it.

Exception hierarchy:
  - ``LockfileSchemaError``: raised when the schema_version is not supported or has
    no upgrade path to the current schema.
  - ``LockfileValidationError``: raised when a field value violates a validation rule.
  - ``LockfileConsistencyError``: raised when ``.mpm`` and ``.mpm.lock`` have
    drifted apart (duplicate alias, alias-set drift, or per-alias ref-spec drift).

Schema migration registry (spec Section 5.2):
  - ``_register_upgrader(from_version, to_version, fn)``: register an upgrader function.
  - ``_unregister_upgrader(from_version, to_version)``: remove a registered upgrader.
  - ``_dispatch_migration(data)``: walk the upgrader chain from data's schema_version
    to CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION, raising LockfileSchemaError if no chain exists.

Schema changelog:
  - v1: original schema (catalog, sources, mpm_hash).
  - v2: added ``marketplace_registered`` (bool) and ``marketplace_dir`` (str) to record
    whether install registered a marketplace plugin and which directory it used.  Old
    v1 lockfiles are migrated transparently by setting both fields to their default
    (false / empty string), preserving backward compatibility.
  - v3: added a PER-SOURCE ``registered_marketplaces`` (list[str]) field to each
    ``[[sources]]`` table -- the sorted set of marketplace names THAT source
    registered during install.  ``mpm clean --orphans`` and the install
    auto-prune consult these per-source ledgers to attribute and prune the
    marketplaces of a removed source.
  - v4 (spec Section 5.2, Section 13 FLAG-C, FR-7 / FR-21): the breaking major.
    Each ``[[sources]]`` lock entry is re-keyed BY ALIAS and carries the per-entry
    fields ``alias, name, url, ref_spec, resolved_ref, resolved_sha, path``.  The
    per-entry version-constraint field (named ``ref_spec`` from v4 onward) is the
    rename of the former v3 field name on every lock entry (source and project).
    The global ``[catalog]`` block is removed
    entirely: the lock no longer serialises or parses a ``[catalog]`` inline table.
    There is NO silent v3 -> v4 upgrader: a loaded v3 (or older) lock fails fast
    with an actionable ``LockfileSchemaError`` instructing the operator to
    regenerate the lock via ``mpm add`` / ``mpm install``.
  - v5 (spec Section 5.2, Section 3.6, FR-22, AMENDED 2026-06-25): npm-style
    content-SHA locking.  Each ``[[sources]]`` entry gains a per-source
    ``[[sources.content_pins]]`` array; each pin row carries ``name`` (the
    manifest ``<project name>``), ``path`` (the project's checkout path), and
    ``resolved_sha`` (the project's resolved content commit SHA captured after
    ``repo sync``).  Reinstalls replay the locked content SHA byte-for-byte; a
    branch ``<project revision>`` only advances on an explicit ``--refresh-lock``.
    The content pins are RESOLVED outputs (like ``resolved_sha``), so they are
    EXCLUDED from ``mpm_hash`` -- ``mpm_hash`` covers only the ``.mpm``
    source triples, never lockfile resolved fields, so a captured pin never
    perturbs the digest or triggers spurious drift.  Like v4, there is NO silent
    v4 -> v5 upgrader: a loaded v4 (or older) lock fails fast with the same
    "regenerate via ``mpm add`` / ``mpm install``" message.

Spec source: spec Section 5 (Lockfile format and validation rules),
Section 4.7.1 (atomicity contract for the lockfile writer), and
Section 5.2 (Lockfile schema migration policy).

    """Verify ``.mpm`` and ``.mpm.lock`` agree (spec FR-24, Section 4.5).

    The shared consistency check that ``mpm validate lockfile`` runs and that
    ``mpm install`` runs before it resolves (spec Section 4.3): a drifted pair
    makes the default install fail fast (exit 1) without mutating the lock.  It
    operates on already-parsed inputs so this module stays a pure lockfile
    component and does not depend on the ``.mpm`` parser.

    Three independent drift conditions are checked, each raising a
    ``LockfileConsistencyError`` naming the offending alias(es):

      1. Alias uniqueness -- ``mpm_aliases`` must contain no duplicate alias.
         A duplicate means two source declarations in ``.mpm`` share an alias,
         which makes the alias-keyed lock ambiguous.
      2. Alias-set parity -- the set of aliases in ``.mpm.lock`` must equal the
         set of aliases declared in ``.mpm``.  An alias present in only one of
         the two files is reported (added in ``.mpm`` but missing from the lock,
         or orphaned in the lock but removed from ``.mpm``).
      3. Per-alias ref-spec parity -- for every shared alias, the ``ref_spec``
         recorded in ``.mpm.lock`` must equal the revision declared for that
         alias in ``.mpm``.

    Args:
        mpm_aliases: The ordered list of source aliases declared in ``.mpm``.
            Passed as a list (not a set) so duplicates are visible and condition
            (1) is checkable.  Every alias must have a matching key in
            ``mpm_ref_specs``.
        mpm_ref_specs: Mapping of each ``.mpm`` alias to its declared revision
            (the ref-spec). The revision is the value compared against the lock
            entry's ``ref_spec`` field.
        lockfile: The parsed ``.mpm.lock`` whose ``sources`` carry the
            alias-keyed entries (schema v5).

    Raises:
        LockfileConsistencyError: If a ``.mpm`` alias is duplicated, if the
            ``.mpm`` and ``.mpm.lock`` alias sets differ, or if any shared
            alias has a mismatched ref-spec.
