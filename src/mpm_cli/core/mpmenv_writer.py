"""Idempotent maintenance of the auto-managed ``.mpm`` global header.

A ``claude-marketplace`` dependency requires the global ``.mpm`` header
``CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR=${HOME}/.claude-marketplaces`` so that
``mpm install`` knows where to register marketplace plugins (spec Section 4.3).
This module keeps that header in sync with the presence of any
``MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_MARKETPLACE=true`` dependency:

* ``ensure_claude_marketplaces_dir`` inserts the header the first time a
  marketplace dependency is added or enabled (never duplicating it, never
  clobbering a custom value an operator hand-set).
* ``prune_claude_marketplaces_dir_if_unused`` removes the header once the last
  marketplace dependency is removed or disabled, so the CWD ``.mpm`` carries no
  stale auto-managed line.

Both functions are idempotent and preserve the file's dominant newline. Matching
is done on the parsed KEY of each line, never on a substring: the literal
``"_MARKETPLACE"`` is a substring of ``"CLAUDE_MARKETPLACES_DIR"``, so a substring
test would falsely treat the header itself as a marketplace dependency.
