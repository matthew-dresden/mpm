"""mpm doctor subcommand: workspace health checks and cache refresh.

Performs workspace health checks and optionally refreshes the completion cache
or prunes stale cache files.
The --refresh-completion-cache flag invalidates all files under
<MPM_HOME>/cache/completion-cache/ (the cache root resolved from MPM_HOME).
The --prune-cache flag removes cache files whose atime is older than
MPM_CACHE_PRUNE_AGE_DAYS days and reports stale install-lock advisories.

Spec reference: ``spec/mpm-list-add-lock-features-spec.md``
Section 4.6 (mpm doctor subchecks 1-5, 7-11), Section 5.1 (mpm_hash),
Section 7 (retry policy, MPM_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT),
Section 11 (cache layout), Section 3.6 (cache files user-private mode 0700).

) -> DoctorFinding:
    """Resolve and report the effective catalog source with its provenance.

    Implements subcheck 6 from spec Section 4.6: determines the effective
    catalog source by walking the precedence chain (first non-empty wins):

      1. ``--catalog-source`` CLI flag (highest precedence).
      2. The single source configured in the ``MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`` env var.
      3. None (no catalog source configured).

    ``MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`` (plural, spec Section 6 / FR-9) is a
    newline-delimited list; when it configures exactly one source that source is
    the effective value, and when it configures several the finding reports the
    ambiguity (single-source commands require ``--catalog-source`` to select one).

    Schema v4 (spec Section 5.2 / FR-7) removed the lockfile ``[catalog]`` block,
    so the lockfile no longer participates in catalog-source provenance.  The
    catalog source for ``mpm add`` / ``mpm search`` / ``mpm outdated`` /
    ``mpm why`` is supplied only by the CLI flag or the env var; ``mpm
    install`` is hermetic and does not consult a catalog source at all.

    This function is pure: it reads no global state directly. All inputs are
    passed as parameters to enable unit testing without environment mutation.

    The provenance suffix is mandatory in every output path -- without it an
    operator can read the effective value but cannot tell WHERE it came from.
    This is the primary mechanism for detecting ``MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES``
    leakage from a shell profile into an unrelated workspace (spec Section 3.6).

    Precedence disambiguation: ``args.catalog_source`` is set to the
    ``_UNSET`` sentinel by the argparse default when the user did not supply
    ``--catalog-source`` on the command line.  Any other value means the user
    explicitly supplied the flag; that value is attributed to the CLI flag
    regardless of whether the env var holds an identical string.

    Args:
        args: Parsed argument namespace. The ``catalog_source`` attribute is
            the ``_UNSET`` sentinel when the CLI flag was not supplied, or the
            user-supplied string when it was.
        env: The process environment dict (pass ``dict(os.environ)`` or a test
            substitute). Read-only: this function never mutates the dict.
        lockfile: Optional Lockfile object. Accepted for call-site symmetry with
            the other subchecks; the v4 lock carries no catalog source, so it does
            not participate in the precedence chain.

    Returns:
        A DoctorFinding with kind="info" whose message contains both the
        effective value and the provenance suffix.
