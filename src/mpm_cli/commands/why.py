"""mpm why subcommand: explain why a project is in the resolved dependency tree.

Reads the .mpm file, resolves the full dependency tree (from .mpm.lock when
present; otherwise live-resolves against the catalog), locates all chains ending
at the requested node, and prints one chain per line.

Chain format (text mode):
  <top-source> -> <include-path>@<sha> -> ... -> <project>@<sha>

Argument matching:
  All categories are evaluated before deciding. No early-exit on first hit. Matched
  nodes are grouped by logical identity, so the same logical node reached by many
  chains (e.g. a transitive include pulled in by many sources) resolves to one
  identity and every chain is printed.
  (a) <project> repo URL -- canonicalized via canonicalize_repo_url. Match against
      every <project> node's canonicalized URL.
  (b) Transitive XML manifest path -- exact-string equality against every <include>
      node's path_in_repo (ref) value.
  (c) Top-level source name -- normalized via derive_source_name so that case and
      dash/underscore differences are treated as equivalent.
  (d) Transitive include name -- normalized via derive_source_name, matched against
      every <include> node's name.

Ambiguity:
  Only when two or more DISTINCT logical interpretations match is a hard error
  raised, naming each distinct interpretation so the operator can disambiguate.

Spec reference: spec/mpm-list-add-lock-features-spec.md Section 4.5
behaviour steps 1-3, 5 (text format). Section 7 for MPM_WHY_FORMAT.
