"""Shared PEP 440 tag-name filter helpers for shell-completion dynamic completers.

Implements the filtering described in spec Section 0.4: tab-completion silently
drops non-PEP-440 tag names. The filter applies to the LAST path component of
a tag ref name (e.g. ``refs/tags/release/v3`` is filtered on ``v3``).

    is_pep440_tag(ref_last_component: str) -> bool
