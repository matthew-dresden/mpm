"""Output sanitizer for shell-completion candidates (spec Section 11.3).

Implements the sanitization described in spec Section 11.3 "Output
sanitization" and the Section 3.6 trust model ("Completion candidates
are shell-escaped").

Rejected character classes (all checked in a single O(n) pass per entry):
- ASCII NUL (0x00).
- ASCII newline (0x0a) or carriage return (0x0d).
- Any character in SHELL_METACHARS (see mpm_cli.constants).
- Any other character below 0x20 (control characters).

    """Filter completion candidates, rejecting entries with forbidden characters.

    Each entry is scanned character-by-character in a single pass (O(n) per
    entry, where n is the entry length). On the first forbidden character the
    entry is immediately dropped with a descriptive reason; no further scanning
    of that entry occurs.

    Forbidden characters (checked in order within the single pass):
    - NUL (0x00) -- "contains NUL"
    - Newline (0x0a) or carriage return (0x0d) -- "contains newline"
    - Shell metacharacters from SHELL_METACHARS -- "contains shell metacharacter '<c>'"
    - Any character with code < 0x20 (control chars) -- "contains control char 0xNN"

    Args:
        entries: Iterable of candidate strings to check.
        completer_name: The name of the calling completer (used by the
            caller to log dropped entries via log_completion_error).

    Returns:
        A SanitizationResult with .kept (clean entries in original order)
        and .dropped (list of (entry, reason) pairs for rejected entries).
