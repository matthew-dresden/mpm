"""Cache layout helpers for mpm shell-completion infrastructure.

Implements the directory structure and file I/O described in spec
Section 11.4.  Every directory created here has mode 0700; every file
written has mode 0600 -- enforced via os.chmod after the write so the
umask cannot weaken the permission.

Layout (all paths relative to cache_dir())::

    catalogs/
        <sha256-of-catalog-url@ref>/
            index.txt       -- one catalog entry name per line
            tags.txt        -- one PEP 440-valid tag + one branch per line
            fetched_at.txt  -- epoch seconds
            accessed_at.txt -- epoch seconds (updated on read, coalesced)
