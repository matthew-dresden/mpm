"""Workspace concurrency lock helper.

Provides the ``mpm_workspace_lock`` context manager that serialises
concurrent mutations to a mpm workspace. Any command that mutates
workspace state (mpm install, mpm add, mpm remove,
mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache) must wrap its mutation
inside this context manager.

POSIX backend (spec Section 4 / FR-32, FR-33, FR-36, issue #67)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The context manager acquires an exclusive kernel-level lock on
``.mpm-data/INSTALL_LOCK_FILENAME`` before yielding control to the caller.
The backend is POSIX-only:

* POSIX (Linux, macOS): ``fcntl.flock(fd, LOCK_EX)``.

This gives **true kernel-level blocking with NO internal poll loop and NO
``sleep``** (CLAUDE.md "no time-based synchronization"). The POSIX
``import fcntl`` lives **inside** ``_exclusive_kernel_lock_posix``, so importing
this module never fails on a platform that lacks ``fcntl`` (there is no column-0
module-top ``import fcntl``).

The lock is released (and the file descriptor closed) on exit regardless of
whether the body raised an exception (try/finally semantics). The kernel
releases the lock automatically when the file descriptor is closed (normal
exit, exception exit, or process termination), so a crashed process never
leaves the workspace permanently locked.

Re-entrance guard (issue #67)
-----------------------------
Opening a new file-description on every entry and then blocking on the lock
while the same process already holds it would deadlock. To prevent that, this
module tracks the set of lock paths currently held by **this** process. A
nested acquisition of a workspace whose lock is already held raises
``WorkspaceLockReentranceError`` immediately with an actionable message --
it never silently no-ops and never deadlocks. Locks for two *distinct*
workspaces may be held simultaneously.

Configurable fail-fast timeout (FR-36)
--------------------------------------
The acquisition timeout is read from
``constants.MPM_WORKSPACE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (env-driven via ``_env_int``,
default 30; no inline literal here). On expiry the acquisition fails fast with
``WorkspaceLockTimeoutError`` carrying an actionable stale-lock-recovery message
(pid / host / timestamp, spec Section 7.3). The timeout is enforced without any
poll loop or ``sleep``:

* POSIX: a kernel timer (``signal.setitimer`` / ``SIGALRM``) interrupts the
  blocking ``flock`` syscall on expiry (PEP 475 does not retry when the handler
  raises).

Eager creation
--------------
Before opening the lock file, the context manager creates ``.mpm-data/`` with
``parents=True, exist_ok=True`` so a fresh workspace does not hit a
``FileNotFoundError`` when the lock file path is opened.

Spec reference: ``specs/mpm-refinements.md`` Section 4 (cross-platform lock
interface), Section 7 (``MPM_WORKSPACE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``), Section 13.2
P4 (Option B fcntl); issue #67.
