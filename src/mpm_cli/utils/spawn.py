"""POSIX detached-process spawn helper.

Provides a single ``spawn_detached`` function that starts a child process
running an arbitrary callable, fully detached from the parent's controlling
terminal and with stdin/stdout/stderr redirected away from the terminal.

Platform behaviour
------------------
POSIX (Linux, macOS):
    Uses ``os.fork()`` once.  The parent returns immediately.  The child calls
    ``os.setsid()`` to start a new session (detaches from the controlling
    terminal), redirects stdin and stdout to ``/dev/null``, redirects stderr to
    the caller-supplied *log_path* (append mode), calls *refresh_fn()*, and
    exits via ``os._exit`` (0 on success, 1 on exception).

Windows is unsupported: mpm targets POSIX hosts (WSL/WSL2 is the recommended
path on Windows in the meantime), so this helper has no Windows backend.

Fail-fast contract
------------------
Any spawn failure raises ``RuntimeError`` with a message that names the
exception class and the underlying OS error.  The caller is responsible for
deciding whether to propagate the error; library code never calls
``sys.exit()``.

    The superseded ``fork_background_refresh`` child logged its failure via
    ``log_completion_error`` before exiting non-zero. This helper preserves
    that behavior for the extracted spawn path: a detached child has no other
    channel to surface a setup or refresh failure, so the error MUST be
    recorded rather than silently swallowed (fail-fast, no silent failures).

    Recording is best-effort: the directory is created with mode 0700 (the
    umask is not trusted) and the traceback is appended. If the log write
    itself raises ``OSError`` (e.g. the filesystem is full), the caller still
    exits non-zero via ``os._exit(1)`` -- the failure is never masked, only the
    redundant logging-of-the-logging-failure is skipped.

    The child is created via ``os.fork()``; the parent returns as soon as the

            file; the child opens it in append mode so that any error output is
            captured without touching the operator's terminal.
