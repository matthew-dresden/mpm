"""MPM repo subsystem -- manifest-driven sync of git projects.

Public API
----------
EMBEDDED
    Boolean flag that is True while run_from_args() is executing, and False
    at all other times. When True, pager.py skips os.execvp() so the calling
    process is not replaced by the pager, and forall.py saves and restores
    signal handlers around command execution.

run_from_args(argv, *, repo_dir)
    Run a repo subcommand from Python code without persistently modifying
    global process state (sys.argv, os.execv, os.environ). The function
    temporarily replaces os.execv and may temporarily write to os.environ
    during execution, but restores both in a finally block. See
    main.run_from_args for the full contract.

repo_init(repo_dir, url, revision, manifest_path, repo_rev)
    Initialize a repo client checkout in repo_dir. Temporarily changes the
    working directory to repo_dir, delegates to run_from_args() with
    ["--color=never", "init", ...] arguments, and restores the working
    directory in a finally block. Raises RepoCommandError on failure.

repo_envsubst(repo_dir, env_vars)
    Perform environment variable substitution in manifest XML files under
    <repo_dir>/.repo/manifests/. Temporarily injects env_vars into os.environ,
    delegates to run_from_args() with ["envsubst"], and restores os.environ
    in a finally block (even on failure). Raises RepoCommandError on failure.

repo_run(argv, *, repo_dir)
    General-purpose dispatcher that accepts an arbitrary argv list and passes
    it to run_from_args(). Returns the exit code (0 for success). Raises
    RepoCommandError on failure or invalid subcommands. Does not mutate
    sys.argv, os.environ, or signal handlers.

repo_sync(repo_dir, *, groups, platform, jobs)
    Clone and fetch all projects defined in the manifest. Delegates to
    run_from_args() with ["sync", ...] arguments. Raises RepoCommandError if
    .repo/ does not exist in repo_dir or if the underlying command fails.
    Does not mutate sys.argv, os.environ, or signal handlers.

RepoCommandError
    Exception raised when the underlying repo command exits with an error.
    Carries the integer exit_code from the original SystemExit.

    Runs ``repo init`` inside repo_dir to configure the manifest URL,
    branch, and manifest file path. Creates the .repo/ subdirectory in
    repo_dir as a side effect of the underlying ``repo init`` command.

    The function temporarily changes the working directory to repo_dir
    before invoking run_from_args() and restores the original working
    directory in a finally block so the calling process observes no
    persistent directory change regardless of whether the call succeeds
    or fails.

        repo_dir: Path to the directory in which ``repo init`` should be
            run. The .repo/ subdirectory will be created inside this directory.
        url: Manifest repository URL (passed to ``repo init -u``).
        revision: Branch or tag to use from the manifest repository
            (passed to ``repo init -b``).

            ``repo init --repo-rev`` when non-empty).

        RepoCommandError: When the underlying ``repo init`` command exits
            with a non-zero exit code. The exit_code attribute of the
