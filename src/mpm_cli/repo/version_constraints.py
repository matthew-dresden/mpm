"""PEP 440 version constraint detection and resolution.

Thin wrapper delegating all version constraint logic to ``mpm_cli.version``,
which is the canonical implementation. This module preserves the function
signatures required by the repo module (``is_version_constraint``,
``resolve_version_constraint``) while eliminating duplicate logic.

Pre-release version behavior:
    By default, PEP 440 constraint specifiers (such as >=1.0.0 or ~=2.0.0)
    exclude pre-release versions (e.g., 1.0.0a1, 1.0.0b2, 1.0.0rc1) unless
    the constraint itself references a pre-release version. This follows the
    semantic versioning rules defined in PEP 440. For example, >=1.0.0 will
    not match 1.0.0a1 even though 1.0.0a1 is technically "before" 1.0.0.
    To include pre-release versions, specify a pre-release constraint
    explicitly (e.g., >=1.0.0a1).

Spec references:
- Section 5.5: PEP 440 constraint syntax table, supported types, resolution.
- Section 17.2: Function signatures for is_version_constraint and
  resolve_version_constraint.

    Examines the last path component of a revision string and returns True

    ==, *) or range syntax (multiple specifiers joined by comma).

    Splits the revision into a prefix and constraint, filters available tags
    by the prefix, parses version suffixes with packaging.version.Version,
    evaluates the constraint with packaging.specifiers.SpecifierSet, and
