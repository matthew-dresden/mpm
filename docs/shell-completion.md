# Shell Completion

mpm supports tab-completion for bash, zsh, and PowerShell via
`mpm completion <shell>`. The supported shell set is
`bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`; any other value (for example `cmd`) is
rejected by argparse with a choice error that names the supported set.

The bash and zsh scripts provide static completions for all
subcommands and flags, plus dynamic completions for catalog entry
names, versions, and other live data fetched through a TTL-cached
local mirror. The PowerShell script provides static completion of the
top-level subcommands (see [PowerShell](#powershell) below).

The `powershell` target is a **cross-platform PowerShell Core
(`pwsh`)** capability: it runs anywhere PowerShell Core runs --
macOS and Linux included -- and is not a claim of native Windows
support. Windows is not currently supported (planned); see the README
[Platform support](../README.md#platform-support) note and use WSL2 in
the meantime.

## Install

### Bash version requirement

mpm's generated bash completion script requires **bash 4.0 or
later**. The macOS stock shell (`/bin/bash`, bash 3.2) is **not
supported**. Install a current bash via Homebrew
(`brew install bash`) and source the completion script from that
shell.

### Auto-updating install (recommended)

Source the completion output inline via `eval`. Every new shell
session runs `mpm completion <shell>` at startup, so the completion
script is always in sync with the installed mpm version.

```bash
# bash -- add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
eval "$(mpm completion bash)"

# zsh -- add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(mpm completion zsh)"
```

After sourcing the script, tab-completion is active for all mpm
subcommands and their arguments. This approach requires no maintenance
after mpm upgrades.

### Static file install (advanced)

Write the completion script to disk once and source it from a fixed
path. This avoids a subprocess call on each shell startup, but the
file must be refreshed manually after mpm upgrades.

```bash
# bash -- system-wide completions directory
mpm completion bash \
  > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/mpm

# zsh -- place the file on your $fpath
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
mpm completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_mpm
```

When using the static approach, run `mpm doctor` after upgrading
mpm. The doctor command detects drift between the installed mpm
version and the content of the static file and emits a warning when
they diverge. See [Update lifecycle](#update-lifecycle) below.

### PowerShell

`mpm completion powershell` targets **PowerShell Core (`pwsh`)**, the
cross-platform PowerShell that runs on macOS and Linux as well as on
Windows. It emits a script that registers a native argument completer
for the `mpm` command via `Register-ArgumentCompleter`. The completer
offers static completion of every top-level mpm subcommand. shtab (used
for bash and zsh) does not support PowerShell, so mpm generates the
PowerShell script directly from the root command parser.

This is a cross-platform `pwsh` capability, not a statement of native
Windows support. Windows is not currently supported (planned); under
WSL2 the bash or zsh completers above apply. See the README
[Platform support](../README.md#platform-support) note.

To enable completion for the current session, evaluate the emitted
script inline:

```powershell
mpm completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

To enable it for every session, append the same line to your
PowerShell profile so it runs at startup:

```powershell
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value 'mpm completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
```

Because the line regenerates the completion script at each session
start, it stays in sync with the installed mpm version, mirroring
the auto-updating `eval` approach used for bash and zsh.

### cmd.exe (no tab-completion)

The legacy Windows Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) has **no programmable
tab-completion mechanism**: there is no `Register-ArgumentCompleter`
equivalent and no completion hook a program can install.

For this reason `cmd` is **not** a value accepted by
`mpm completion`. The supported set is `bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`;
running `mpm completion cmd` produces an argparse choice error that
names that supported set. This is a documented gap (FR-39), not a
defect.

Windows is not currently supported (planned); see the README
[Platform support](../README.md#platform-support) note. Run mpm under
WSL2 and use the bash or zsh completers above, or use the cross-platform
PowerShell Core (`pwsh`) completer (see [PowerShell](#powershell)).

## Update lifecycle

For the **auto-updating** method (`eval "$(mpm completion <shell>)"`
in your rc file), the completion script is regenerated on each shell
startup and is always current. No maintenance is required after a
mpm upgrade.

For the **static file** method, the on-disk script must be
regenerated manually after each mpm upgrade:

```bash
mpm completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/mpm
# or
mpm completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_mpm
```

**When to regenerate:**

- After running `pipx upgrade missing-package-manager` or any other upgrade method.
- After installing mpm in a new environment.
- When `mpm doctor` emits a completion-script staleness warning.

**How staleness is detected:**

`mpm doctor` compares the hash of the on-disk static file against a
fresh invocation of `mpm completion <shell>`. When they differ, the
doctor output includes a warning under check 9 ("Completion script
staleness"). Run `mpm completion <shell> > <path>` to refresh, or
switch to the auto-updating `eval` approach to eliminate this
maintenance step. See [mpm doctor](doctor.md) for the full list of
health checks.

## Dynamic completers

The completion script includes a preamble block that defines
mpm-specific shell helper functions. Each helper calls a
corresponding `mpm __complete_<name>` hidden subcommand at
tab-press time. The subcommand writes candidates to stdout (one per
line); the shell function hands them to the shell completion machinery.

All completers are failure-quiet on stdout (return an empty list on
error) and failure-loud on stderr (append a structured error line to
`${MPM_HOME}/cache/completion-errors.log`). This keeps the shell UX
non-blocking while ensuring errors are captured for `mpm doctor` to
surface.

### `__complete_catalog_entries`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_catalog_entries`

Retrieves available catalog entry names from the local cache.
Reads `${MPM_HOME}/cache/catalogs/<sha256>/index.txt`, where the
sha256 is derived from `"<catalog-url>@<ref>"`. On cache miss, the
command performs an inline network fetch bounded by
`MPM_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT` before returning results.

Used for completing the `<name>[@<spec>]` positional argument of
`mpm add`. (`mpm bootstrap` was removed in 3.0.0 with no shim; see
[docs/migration-to-add.md](migration-to-add.md).)

### `__complete_source_names_in_mpm`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_source_names_in_mpm`

Retrieves source names defined in the `.mpm` file for the current
project. Reads `${MPM_MANIFEST_FILE:-./.mpm}` and emits one
normalized source name per line (parsed from `MPM_SOURCE_<name>_URL`
keys).

Used for completing arguments to `mpm remove` and
`mpm install --refresh-lock-source`. Note: normalization is
one-way -- the original entry name is not recoverable from the source
name. Tab-completion is suggest-only.

### `__complete_names_in_lockfile`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_names_in_lockfile`

Retrieves names recorded in the lockfile. Resolves the lockfile path
using the three-tier precedence chain:

1. `${MPM_LOCK_FILE}` -- explicit lockfile path override.
2. `${MPM_MANIFEST_FILE}.lock` -- derived from the mpm file env var.
3. `./.mpm.lock` -- default path in the current directory.

Emits, one per line (sorted, deduplicated):

- Every top-level source name.
- Every transitive include `path_in_repo` value (recursive through
  nested includes).
- Every project URL.

Used for completing the `<name-or-url>` positional argument of
`mpm why`.

### `__complete_catalog_versions`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_catalog_versions`

Retrieves available versions for a catalog entry. Calls
`git ls-remote --tags --heads` against the manifest repo, filters
results to PEP 440-valid tags and branches, and returns them one per
line (deduped). Results are cached in
`${MPM_HOME}/cache/catalogs/<sha256>/tags.txt`.

Used when completing `@<version>` suffixes on `mpm add` arguments.

### `__complete_project_versions`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_project_versions`

Retrieves available versions for a project repository URL. Takes
two positional arguments: the project repo URL (first) and the
current completion prefix (second). Calls
`git ls-remote --tags --heads <repo-url>`, filters to PEP 440-valid
tags and branches, and returns them one per line (deduped, sorted).
Results are cached in
`${MPM_HOME}/cache/projects/<sha256>/tags.txt`.

**URL canonicalization:** Before computing the cache key, the raw
repo URL is canonicalized via the internal `canonicalize_repo_url`
helper (spec Section 4.0). Two URL shapes that resolve to the same
canonical URL share the same cache entry. For example,
`https://example.com/org/proj.git` and
`git@example.com:org/proj.git` both canonicalize to
`https://example.com/org/proj` and therefore hash to the same
`projects/<sha256>/tags.txt` file. The original (non-canonical) URL
is passed to `git ls-remote` so the transport (SSH, HTTPS, file,
etc.) is preserved. A malformed URL that cannot be canonicalized
produces empty stdout and a structured log entry.

Used when completing the `<spec>` portion of `mpm add foo@<TAB>`.

### `__complete_cached_catalogs`

**Shell helper:** `_mpm_complete_cached_catalogs`

Retrieves locally cached catalog identifiers. Enumerates
`${MPM_HOME}/cache/catalogs/*/` directories and reads the
`origin.txt` sidecar from each sha-named entry. Emits one
`<url>@<ref>` string per line, sorted lexicographically, filtered
by the current completion prefix.

The completer never recurses into subdirectories of
`catalogs/<sha>/`; it reads `origin.txt` from each sha directory
only.

- **Empty or missing `catalogs/`** -- returns empty stdout without
  writing a log entry (first-run or empty cache is not an error).
- **Malformed `origin.txt`** (empty file or no `@` separator) --
  the entry is skipped and a structured log entry naming the
  offending sha directory is appended to `completion-errors.log`.

Used when completing the `--catalog-source <url>@<ref>` flag for
`mpm search`, `mpm add`, `mpm outdated`, and related commands.

### Mid-token splitting

The `_mpm_complete_add_arg` shell helper drives `mpm add <name>[@<spec>]`
completion. It applies the LAST-`@` split rule (spec Section 4.0) to the
current completion token and routes to the appropriate completer.

**LAST-`@` split rule.** The token is split at the LAST `@` character. The
portion before the last `@` is the entry name; the portion after is the spec
prefix. Examples:

| Token | Entry name | Spec prefix |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `foo` | `foo` | (no `@` present) |
| `foo@` | `foo` | `""` |
| `foo@1` | `foo` | `1` |
| `foo@bar@baz` | `foo@bar` | `baz` |
| `@1.0.0` | `""` | `1.0.0` |

**Routing table.** After the split:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| No `@` in token | Call `_mpm_complete_catalog_entries <token>` |
| `@` present AND resolver returns a URL | Call `_mpm_complete_project_versions <repo-url> <spec>` |
| `@` present AND resolver fails (unknown entry or disabled) | Emit empty; no error output |

**Entry-name to repo-URL resolution.** When `@` is detected, the shell helper
shells out to `mpm __resolve_entry_to_repo_url <name>` to obtain the
catalog source URL for that entry. The subcommand consults the local
completion cache (populated by `mpm __complete_catalog_entries`) and returns
the catalog git URL on stdout, or exits non-zero if the entry is not cached.
If the subcommand exits non-zero or returns an empty URL, the splitter emits
no candidates for the spec portion.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_ENABLED=0`.** When completion is disabled, the splitter
returns immediately without shelling out to `__resolve_entry_to_repo_url`.
The COMPREPLY / compadd list is left empty.

## Cache and environment variables

The following environment variables control cache and completion
behaviour. All variables must be set in the shell before sourcing the
completion script (or before any `mpm` invocation for
per-process settings).

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full environment
variable reference table.

**`MPM_HOME`** -- Root mpm home directory; cache lives under
`${MPM_HOME}/cache`. Controls where completion index files, version
lists, and error logs are written. Defaults to `~/.mpm-home`.
Override to place the home directory on a faster or larger volume.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_CACHE_TTL`** (default `300`) -- Cache
time-to-live in seconds. Entries whose `fetched_at.txt` is within
this window are returned immediately. Older entries trigger a
background refresh when `MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG=1`.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT`** (default `2`) -- Timeout in seconds
for each inline subprocess call during a cache-miss fetch. Increase
on slow networks; decrease if tab-presses feel sluggish.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_REFRESH_BG`** (default `1`) -- When `1`, a stale
cache entry is returned immediately while a child process refreshes
it in the background. Set to `0` to suppress background refreshes;
stale data is then returned until an inline refresh occurs.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_ENABLED`** (default `1`) -- Set to `0` to disable
all dynamic argument lookups. Static subcommand and flag completion
remains active; only dynamic completers (`mpm __complete_*`) are
suppressed.

**`MPM_ACCESSED_AT_COALESCE_SEC`** (default `60`) -- Coalescing
window in seconds for `accessed_at.txt` updates. Limits I/O under
rapid tab-pressing by suppressing redundant writes within this window.

**`MPM_COMPLETION_LOG`** (default
`${MPM_HOME}/cache/completion-errors.log`) -- Path to the
append-only error log written by `__complete_*` subcommands. Override
to redirect completion-time errors to a custom path.

### Cache layout

```text
${MPM_HOME}/cache/
  catalogs/
    <sha256-of-catalog-url@ref>/
      index.txt      -- one catalog entry name per line
      tags.txt       -- one PEP 440-valid tag or branch per line
      fetched_at.txt -- Unix epoch seconds of last remote fetch
      accessed_at.txt -- Unix epoch seconds of last read
      origin.txt     -- "<url>@<ref>" sidecar
  projects/
    <sha256-of-canonical-project-repo-url>/
      tags.txt       -- one PEP 440-valid tag or branch per line
      fetched_at.txt -- Unix epoch seconds of last remote fetch
      accessed_at.txt -- Unix epoch seconds of last read
      origin.txt     -- canonical "<repo-url>"
  completion-errors.log -- append-only error log
```

All cache directories are created with mode `0700`; all cache files
are written with mode `0600`. The process umask cannot weaken these
permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### Stale cache

If completion results are outdated after adding new entries to a
catalog, the cache has not yet refreshed.

1. Wait for the background refresh to complete (triggered on the next
   tab-press after the TTL expires).
2. Force an immediate refresh:

   ```bash
   mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache
   ```

3. Prune the entire cache and let it rebuild:

   ```bash
   mpm doctor --prune-cache
   ```

### Refreshing the completion cache without a workspace

`mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache` and
`mpm doctor --prune-cache` operate on `MPM_HOME` globally
and do NOT require a `.mpm` workspace to be present in the current
directory. Both flags inspect and modify only the cache directory;
they never read or write `.mpm` or `.mpm.lock`. This means they
can be invoked from any directory -- including `$HOME` or a
freshly-created empty directory -- with no project context.

Example: refresh the completion cache from `$HOME` (no `.mpm`
present):

```bash
cd ~
mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache
# exit 0; output similar to:
# [ok] Completion cache refreshed (MPM_HOME=~/.mpm-home)
```

Example: prune the entire cache from any directory:

```bash
mpm doctor --prune-cache
# exit 0; output similar to:
# [ok] Cache pruned (MPM_HOME=~/.mpm-home)
```

Override the home directory via `MPM_HOME` to target a
non-default location:

```bash
MPM_HOME=/tmp/my-mpm-home mpm doctor --refresh-completion-cache
```

See [docs/installation.md](installation.md) for the broader
completion-installation context and initial setup instructions.

### Log file location

Errors that occur inside `__complete_*` subcommands are written to
the completion error log. The default path is:

`${MPM_HOME}/cache/completion-errors.log`

Override the path via `MPM_COMPLETION_LOG`. The log is append-only
and is never rotated automatically. Truncate or remove it manually,
or run `mpm doctor --prune-cache` to clear it along with the rest
of the cache.

Each log line follows this format:

```text
<ISO-8601-UTC> <completer-name> <ErrorClass>: <message>
```

Use `mpm doctor` to surface the most recent completion errors in a
human-readable summary.

### Disabling dynamic completion

Set `MPM_COMPLETION_ENABLED=0` to disable all dynamic argument
lookups for the current shell session:

```bash
export MPM_COMPLETION_ENABLED=0
```

Static subcommand and flag completion (subcommand names, option
strings) remain active. Only the dynamic completers that shell out to
`mpm __complete_*` are suppressed.

### Completion feels slow on cache miss

Reduce `MPM_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT` (default `2` seconds) to make
cache-miss fetches fail faster:

```bash
export MPM_COMPLETION_TIMEOUT=1
```

Or disable inline fetches entirely with `MPM_COMPLETION_ENABLED=0`
and rely on cached results only.
