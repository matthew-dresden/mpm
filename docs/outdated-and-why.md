## mpm outdated

Report installable upgrades per source.

### outdated -- Synopsis

```text
mpm outdated [--catalog-source <git-url>@<ref>]
               [--mpm-file <path>]
               [--lock-file <path>]
               [--format {table,json}]
               [--fail-on-upgrade]
               [--no-color]
```

### outdated -- How it works

`mpm outdated` resolves the catalog identified by `--catalog-source`
(or `MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`), then reads every
`MPM_SOURCE_<name>_*` block from the `.mpm` file and compares the
currently-installed version against what the catalog now offers.

Steps:

1. Resolve the catalog source (required -- no lockfile fallback for
   this command; see [docs/configuration.md](configuration.md) for
   the `MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES` env var).
2. Read the `.mpm` file.
3. For each source block:
   - Determine the **current** resolved version from `.mpm.lock`
     when present; otherwise live-resolve against the catalog.
   - Determine **latest-matching-spec**: the highest version that
     still satisfies the PEP 440 constraint recorded in the source
     block.
   - Determine **latest-available**: the highest version that exists
     in the catalog regardless of the recorded constraint (shows the
     "relaxed upgrade" ceiling).
4. Emit one output row per source.

### outdated -- Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--catalog-source <url>@<ref>` | env | Catalog source. |
| `--mpm-file <path>` | `./.mpm` | Declaration file. |
| `--lock-file <path>` | derived | Lockfile path. |
| `--format {table,json}` | `table` | Output format. |
| `--fail-on-upgrade` | off | Exit 1 on upgrade. |
| `--no-color` | auto | Disable ANSI color. |

Environment variable overrides: `--catalog-source` =
`MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`, `--mpm-file` = `MPM_MPM_FILE`,
`--lock-file` = `MPM_LOCK_FILE`, `--format` =
`MPM_OUTDATED_FORMAT`. See
[docs/configuration.md](configuration.md) for details.

### outdated -- Exit codes

| Condition | Exit code |
| --------- | --------- |
| Completed normally, no upgrades available | `0` |
| Completed normally, upgrades available (default) | `0` |
| Upgrades available, `--fail-on-upgrade` passed | `1` |
| Catalog source not configured | `1` |
| `.mpm` file not found | `1` |
| Manifest repo contains zero PEP 440-parseable tags | `1` |
| Any unhandled error | `1` |

See [docs/exit-codes.md](exit-codes.md) for the full exit-code table.

The default exit-0 design follows the convention of `pip list
--outdated`, `npm outdated`, and `cargo outdated`: the report is
informational and does not block downstream pipeline steps unless the
operator opts in with `--fail-on-upgrade`.

### outdated -- Output format: table (default)

The table is preceded by one alias-render line per source
(`<alias> -> <source-name> from <url>@<ref>`); columns are joined with ` | `
and the separator row uses `-+-`:

```text
$ mpm outdated \
    --catalog-source \
    https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main

package-a -> package_a from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@~=1.2.0
package-b -> package_b from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@==3.0.0
package-c -> package_c from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
name      | current      | latest-matching-spec | latest-available | upgrade-type
----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------+-------------
package-a | 1.2.0        | 1.2.1                | 2.0.0            | patch
package-b | 3.0.0        | 3.0.0                | 3.1.0            | none
package-c | a1b2c3d4e5f6 | f6e5d4c3b2a1         | f6e5d4c3b2a1     | drift
```

Column definitions:

| Column | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `name` | Source name (normalized alias) from `MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_*`. |
| `current` | Version or 12-char SHA currently in `.mpm.lock`. |
| `latest-matching-spec` | Highest version satisfying the PEP 440 constraint. |
| `latest-available` | Highest version ignoring the constraint. |
| `upgrade-type` | One of `none`, `patch`, `minor`, `major`, or `drift`. |

### outdated -- Branch-pinned source drift column

When a source's `MPM_SOURCE_<alias>_REF` value is a branch name (e.g.,
`main`, `develop`) rather than a PEP 440 tag, version comparison is not
applicable. Instead:

- Both `latest-matching-spec` and `latest-available` display the current HEAD
  SHA of that branch, truncated to 12 characters.
- `upgrade-type` reads `drift` when the SHA in `.mpm.lock` differs from the
  branch HEAD.
- `upgrade-type` reads `none` when the locked SHA matches the branch HEAD.

Example -- `package-c` has drifted from the locked commit:

```text
name      | current      | latest-matching-spec | latest-available | upgrade-type
----------+--------------+----------------------+------------------+-------------
package-c | a1b2c3d4e5f6 | f6e5d4c3b2a1         | f6e5d4c3b2a1     | drift
```

Operators who want deterministic installs should switch branch-pinned
sources to tag-based pinning with a PEP 440 constraint.

### outdated -- Output format: --format json

The JSON payload is a top-level object with two keys: `aliases` (the
alias-render strings) and `sources` (one object per source). Each source
object has exactly five hyphenated string keys:

```json
{
  "aliases": [
    "package-a -> package_a from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@~=1.2.0",
    "package-b -> package_b from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@==3.0.0",
    "package-c -> package_c from https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main"
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "package-a",
      "current": "1.2.0",
      "latest-matching-spec": "1.2.1",
      "latest-available": "2.0.0",
      "upgrade-type": "patch"
    },
    {
      "name": "package-b",
      "current": "3.0.0",
      "latest-matching-spec": "3.0.0",
      "latest-available": "3.1.0",
      "upgrade-type": "none"
    },
    {
      "name": "package-c",
      "current": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
      "latest-matching-spec": "f6e5d4c3b2a1",
      "latest-available": "f6e5d4c3b2a1",
      "upgrade-type": "drift"
    }
  ]
}
```

### outdated -- Error scenarios

#### Missing catalog source

```text
ERROR: mpm outdated requires a catalog source.
Provide one of:
  --catalog-source <git-url>@<ref>       # e.g. --catalog-source https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
  MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES=<git-url>@<ref>  # set as env var (one entry per line), then re-run

The CLI flag takes precedence when both are set.
A catalog source identifies a manifest repo (a git repository whose
repo-specs/ directory exposes installable mpm dependencies).
See docs/catalogs-explained.md for what a manifest repo is and how to find one.
See docs/configuration.md for the full configuration reference.
```

#### Manifest repo with no PEP 440 tags

When a tag-pinned source resolves against a manifest repo whose tags all have
a last path component that is not a valid PEP 440 version (e.g., `v1.0.0`,
`release-2024`), the version resolver raises a loud error. `mpm outdated`
prints it to stderr and exits non-zero immediately on that source (before the
table is printed):

```text
ERROR: No PEP 440-parseable version tags found under '<prefix>'.
Skipped 2 tag(s) whose last path component is not a valid PEP 440 version:
  - refs/tags/release-2024
  - refs/tags/v1.0.0
Run 'mpm catalog audit --check tag-format' against the manifest repo
to identify every non-PEP-440 tag, then ask the catalog author to rename
them to PEP 440 form (e.g., 'release-1.0.0' -> '1.0.0').
```

---

## mpm why

Explain why a package, XML manifest, or source is present in the
resolved dependency tree.

### why -- Synopsis

```text
mpm why <name-or-url> [--mpm-file <path>]
          [--lock-file <path>]
          [--catalog-source <git-url>@<ref>]
          [--format {text,json}]
          [--no-color]
```

### why -- How it works

`mpm why` reads `.mpm` (and `.mpm.lock` when present) to build
the full resolved dependency tree, then traces every chain that ends at
the node identified by `<name-or-url>`. It resolves the tree from the
lockfile when available; a live catalog source is required only when no
lockfile exists.

### why -- Accepted argument shapes

The single positional argument is matched in the following precedence:

| Shape | Example |
| ----- | ------- |
| Project URL | `https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git` |
| Source URL | `https://example.com/org/catalog-repo.git` |
| Root manifest path | `repo-specs/package-a-marketplace.xml` |
| Transitive XML manifest path | `repo-specs/network/remote.xml` |
| Transitive include name | `remote` |
| Entry name | `package-a` |
| Source name | `package_a` |

Notes:

- Project URLs and source URLs are canonicalized via `canonicalize_repo_url`
  before matching, so `http://` vs `https://` and trailing `.git` differences
  are normalized.
- Both the entry-name form (`package-a`) and the normalized source-name
  form (`package_a`) are accepted for top-level sources.
- **Source URL** -- the git URL of the manifest repo itself (i.e.
  `MPM_SOURCE_<name>_URL`) -- resolves to the owning source chain.
- **Root manifest path** -- the `MPM_SOURCE_<name>_PATH` value (e.g.
  `repo-specs/package-a-marketplace.xml`) -- resolves to the owning source
  on the live-resolve path.
- **Transitive include name** -- the `name` of an `<include>` node, normalized
  via `derive_source_name`, resolves to that include wherever it appears in the
  tree (queryable interchangeably with its manifest path).
- Matched nodes are grouped by logical identity. When a single logical node is
  reached by many chains (for example a transitive include pulled in by several
  sources), every chain is printed. An ambiguity error is raised only when the
  argument matches two or more **distinct** interpretations (different kinds, or
  different logical nodes).

### why -- Placeholder fetch URLs on the live-resolve path

When no `.mpm.lock` is present (`mpm why` operates in live-resolve mode),
the manifest XML may declare a remote fetch URL using a `${VAR}` placeholder,
for example `<remote name="pkgs" fetch="${GITBASE}">`.  `mpm why` resolves
these placeholders from the `.mpm` globals (the non-source, non-special
`KEY=VALUE` pairs written by `mpm add`, such as `GITBASE=https://github.com/org`).

This substitution uses `os.path.expandvars` -- the same primitive that
`mpm repo envsubst` uses -- applied before URL canonicalization.

If a `${VAR}` placeholder is declared in the manifest but the matching
variable is absent from the `.mpm` globals, `mpm why` exits with an
actionable error naming the missing variable and the `.mpm` file path.

Using a concrete `fetch` URL (no placeholder) remains fully supported -- the
substitution step is skipped for fetch values that contain no `${...}` patterns.

### why -- Match annotation

Before printing any chain, `mpm why` emits a one-line annotation
confirming the matched category and the queried token:

```text
matched url 'https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git'
```

The annotation form differs by query type:

| Query form | Annotation example |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Project URL | `matched url 'https://example.com/org/proj.git'` |
| Source URL | `matched url 'https://example.com/org/catalog.git'` |
| Root manifest path | `matched xml_path 'repo-specs/package-a-marketplace.xml'` |
| Transitive XML path | `matched xml_path 'repo-specs/network/remote.xml'` |
| Source name | `matched source_name 'package_a'` |
| Transitive include name | `matched include_name 'remote'` |

The annotation is emitted on the first output line. The chain line(s)
follow unchanged. The annotation is omitted on error paths (miss,
ambiguity).

### why -- Chain walking

For every matching node, `mpm why` prints all resolution chains that
lead to it after the match annotation. A chain walks the `<include>`
graph from a top-level source entry down to the requested node:

```text
$ mpm why https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git \
    --catalog-source \
    https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main

matched url 'https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git'
package-a -> repo-specs/base.xml@a1b2c3d4e5f6 \
    -> repo-specs/network/remote.xml@b2c3d4e5f6a1 \
    -> https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@c3d4e5f6a1b2
```

Each node in the chain is annotated with its resolved SHA.

When the requested node is reached by multiple chains -- for example a
transitive include pulled in by several top-level sources, or a diamond in the
include graph -- every chain is printed under the single match annotation.

### why -- Cycle detection

If the transitive include graph contains a cycle (e.g., `A.xml`
includes `B.xml` which includes `A.xml`), `mpm why` exits with a
hard error before printing any output:

```text
ERROR: include cycle detected:
  repo-specs/base.xml -> repo-specs/ext.xml -> repo-specs/base.xml
Remove the cycle from the manifest repo and re-run.
```

### why -- Diamond deduplication

When two separate `<include>` paths both resolve to the same XML
manifest, the manifest is processed once. Both chains are shown in the
output, but the manifest itself is not duplicated in the resolution
tree:

```text
package-a -> repo-specs/base.xml@a1b2c3d4e5f6 \
    -> repo-specs/shared.xml@d4e5f6a1b2c3
package-a -> repo-specs/extra.xml@e5f6a1b2c3d4 \
    -> repo-specs/shared.xml@d4e5f6a1b2c3
```

### why -- Ambiguity behaviour

`mpm why` raises an ambiguity error only when the argument matches two or
more **distinct** interpretations -- different kinds (for example a string that
is both a valid source name and a valid XML path), or different logical nodes.
The same logical node reached by many chains is **not** an ambiguity; all of its
chains are printed. On a genuine ambiguity the command exits non-zero, listing
each distinct interpretation:

```text
ERROR: argument 'shared' is ambiguous: it matches 2 distinct interpretations:
  source name: shared
  XML manifest path: repo-specs/shared.xml
Disambiguate by passing one of the exact tokens above.
```

### why -- Not-found behaviour

If the argument matches nothing in the resolved tree, `mpm why` exits
with a hard error. When candidates exist within edit distance 3
(Levenshtein), up to 3 closest matches are suggested:

```text
$ mpm why pacakge-a \
    --catalog-source \
    https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main

ERROR: 'pacakge-a' not found in the resolved dependency tree.
Did you mean one of:
  package-a  (edit distance 2)
  package-b  (edit distance 3)
```

When no candidates are within the threshold, the error omits the
suggestion block:

```text
ERROR: 'zzz-unknown' not found in the resolved dependency tree.
```

The suggestion threshold and maximum number of suggestions are
configurable via environment variables; see
[docs/configuration.md](configuration.md) for
`MPM_WHY_SUGGEST_MAX_DISTANCE` and `MPM_WHY_SUGGEST_TOP_N`.

### why -- Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `--catalog-source <url>@<ref>` | env | Required when no lockfile. |
| `--mpm-file <path>` | `./.mpm` | Declaration file. |
| `--lock-file <path>` | derived | Lockfile path. |
| `--format {text,json}` | `text` | Output format. |
| `--no-color` | auto | Disable ANSI color. |

Environment variable overrides: `--catalog-source` =
`MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES`, `--mpm-file` = `MPM_MPM_FILE`,
`--lock-file` = `MPM_LOCK_FILE`, `--format` = `MPM_WHY_FORMAT`.
See [docs/configuration.md](configuration.md) for details.

### why -- Output format: --format json

With `--format json`, the output is a top-level JSON object with two
keys: `matched` (the match annotation) and `chains` (the chain data).

```json
{
  "matched": {
    "category": "url",
    "token": "https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git"
  },
  "chains": [
    [
      {
        "kind": "source",
        "name": "package-a",
        "ref": null,
        "sha": "a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2",
        "url": "https://example.com/org/catalog-repo.git"
      },
      {
        "kind": "include",
        "name": "repo-specs/base.xml",
        "ref": "repo-specs/base.xml",
        "sha": "b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3",
        "url": null
      },
      {
        "kind": "project",
        "name": "remote-lib",
        "ref": null,
        "sha": "c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4",
        "url": "https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

`matched` object fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `category` | One of `url`, `xml_path`, `source_name`. |
| `token` | The exact matched token (URL, XML path, or source name). |

`matched.category` values by query form:

| Query form | `category` value |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Project or source URL | `url` |
| Root or transitive XML manifest path | `xml_path` |
| Source name | `source_name` |

Node `kind` values in `chains`:

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `source` | A top-level `MPM_SOURCE_<name>_*` entry from `.mpm`. |
| `include` | A transitive `<include>` XML manifest file. |
| `project` | A `<project>` package repo entry in an XML manifest. |

Each node has exactly five fields: `kind`, `name`, `ref`, `sha`, `url`.
`ref` is the XML path for include nodes and `null` for source and
project nodes. `url` is the canonical HTTPS URL for project and source
nodes and `null` for include nodes.

JSON indentation defaults to 2 spaces. Configure via
`MPM_WHY_JSON_INDENT` (see
[docs/configuration.md](configuration.md)).

## CI integration patterns

Both commands integrate naturally into automated pipelines. The typical
pattern is to run `mpm outdated --fail-on-upgrade` on a schedule and
take action (open a ticket, fail a PR gate) when upgrades are
available.

### GitHub Actions

The following workflow runs a nightly check and opens a GitHub issue
when upgrades are found. The `mpm outdated --format json` output is
captured for the issue body.

```yaml
name: dependency-drift

on:
  schedule:
    # Run at 06:00 UTC every day
    - cron: "0 6 * * *"
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  check-outdated:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES: >-
        https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install mpm
        run: pip install mpm

      - name: Check for upgrades
        id: outdated
        # Exit 1 when upgrades are available; capture for issue body
        run: |
          set +e
          mpm outdated --fail-on-upgrade --format json \
            > outdated.json 2>&1
          echo "exit_code=$?" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

      - name: Open issue on drift
        if: steps.outdated.outputs.exit_code != '0'
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          gh issue create \
            --title "mpm: upgrades available ($(date -u +%Y-%m-%d))" \
            --body "$(cat outdated.json)" \
            --label "dependencies"
```

Key points:

- `MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES` is set as a job-level env var so all steps
  inherit it without repeating the flag.
- `set +e` prevents the shell from exiting before `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` is
  written.
- The `--format json` output is machine-readable and suitable as an
  issue or PR description body.

### Generic shell CI

For CI systems without a native YAML DSL (Jenkins, Buildkite custom
agents, Makefile targets), use a plain shell conditional:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

export MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES="https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main"

echo "Checking for mpm dependency upgrades..."

if ! mpm outdated --fail-on-upgrade; then
  echo "ERROR: mpm dependency upgrades are available." >&2
  echo "Run 'mpm outdated' for details, then update .mpm" >&2
  echo "and commit a refreshed lock." >&2
  exit 1
fi

echo "All mpm dependencies are up to date."
```

Adapt the error-handling block to your CI system's notification
mechanism (Slack webhook, PagerDuty alert, email, etc.).

PR gate variant: include the script as a required check in your CI
configuration. When `mpm outdated --fail-on-upgrade` exits 1, the
check fails and the PR cannot merge until the `.mpm` file is updated
and a new lock is committed.
