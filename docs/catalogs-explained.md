# Catalogs explained

A **manifest repo** is a git repository whose `repo-specs/` directory contains
installable mpm dependency definitions. When you point mpm at a manifest
repo via `--catalog-source`, you are pointing it at the catalog itself -- there
is no separate "catalog" entity inside the repository, and no `catalog/<name>/`
subdirectory model. The repository is the catalog; each `repo-specs/**/*.xml`
file that contains a `<catalog-metadata>` block is a catalog entry (any
filename; the `-marketplace.xml` suffix is a convention, not a requirement).

## What is a manifest repo?

A manifest repo (also called a **catalog repo**) is a git repository that
exposes installable mpm dependencies. Its structure is:

```text
repo-specs/
  my-library-marketplace.xml
  another-tool-marketplace.xml
  ...
```

Each XML file with a `<catalog-metadata>` block is a **catalog entry** -- a single dependency
definition identified by the `<name>` child of its `<catalog-metadata>` block.
The `<name>` value is the **entry name**. There is exactly one
`<catalog-metadata>` block per XML file, and entry names must be unique across
the manifest repo.

When you install a catalog entry, mpm writes a source block into your
`.mpm` file using the **source name** -- a normalized form of the entry name
derived by lowercasing it and replacing every `-` with `_`. For example, the
entry name `My-Library` becomes the source name `my_library`, and mpm writes
the triple `MPM_SOURCE_my_library_URL` (and related keys) into your `.mpm`
file.

A **catalog source** is a `<git-url>@<ref>` value that identifies a manifest
repo at a specific revision. You pass it via `--catalog-source` or the
`MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES` environment variable. For example:

```text
https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
```

mpm does not ship a built-in catalog. There is no default catalog source
(the `mpm bootstrap` command was removed in 3.0.0). Your organization hosts
its own manifest repo (or uses a shared community one), and you tell mpm
where to find it.

## Who runs manifest repos?

Any team or individual can run a manifest repo. The manifest repo model is
vendor-agnostic: it requires only a git host that supports standard `git clone`
and `git ls-remote` operations.

Common arrangements include:

- A platform engineering team that maintains a shared internal catalog for their
  organization.
- A project team that publishes a manifest repo alongside the libraries or tools
  they own, so consumers can install them with `mpm add`.
- An open-source project that ships a public manifest repo any organization can
  point `--catalog-source` at.
- Individual developers who maintain a personal manifest repo for their own
  scripts and utilities.

No registry, no central authority, and no approval process are required. If you
control a git repository and can push `*-marketplace.xml` files to it, you can
run a manifest repo.

See [creating-manifest-repos.md](creating-manifest-repos.md) for a complete
guide to authoring and publishing your own catalog entries.

## How to find a manifest repo to point at

If you need dependencies managed by another team or project, the manifest repo
URL is the starting point. Here are the most reliable ways to find it:

1. **Ask the team that owns the dependencies.** The team that builds and
   releases the software you want to install is the authoritative source for
   its manifest repo URL. Check their project README or internal documentation
   first.

2. **Look for repos with a `repo-specs/` directory.** Manifest repos are
   identifiable by the presence of a `repo-specs/` directory containing
   `*-marketplace.xml` files. Searching your organization's git host for
   repositories with this structure will surface available catalogs.

3. **Consult the project that built the dependency.** Open-source projects
   that publish mpm-compatible releases typically document the catalog source
   URL in their README or contributing guide.

Once you have a manifest repo URL and a ref (branch name, tag, or commit SHA),
combine them as `<git-url>@<ref>` to form the catalog source value.

## Worked example

This example lists every available dependency in a manifest repo and then adds
one to your `.mpm` file.

```bash
# List every catalog entry in the manifest repo
mpm search --catalog-source https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
```

Sample output:

```text
my-library
another-tool
```

```bash
# Add one entry (mpm resolves the latest PEP 440 tag automatically)
mpm add my-library --catalog-source https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main

# Or export the catalog source so every command uses it automatically
export MPM_CATALOG_SOURCES=https://example.com/org/manifest-repo.git@main
mpm search
mpm add my-library
```

After `mpm add`, your `.mpm` file contains a source block keyed on the
derived source name (e.g., `MPM_SOURCE_my_library_URL`).
